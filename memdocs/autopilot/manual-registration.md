# Manual registration overview

**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10
- Windows Holographic, version 2004

Ideally, registration of a device with Windows Autopilot is performed by the OEM, reseller, or distributor from which the device was purchased. However it is also possible to register devices manually. You might need to register a device manually if:
- The device was obtained from a non-participant device manufacturer or reseller.
- The device is a virtual machine (VM).
- The device does not otherwise qualify for automatic registraton, such as an existing legacy device.

For a list of participant device manufacturers and device resellers, see [Autopilot device manufacturers and resellers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/windows-autopilot#office-SecondaryMessaging-k4if896).

To [manually register a device](add-devices.md), you must first capture its hardware hash. Once this process has completed, the resulting hardware hash can be uploaded to the Windows Autopilot service. Because this process requires booting the device into Windows 10 to obtain the hardware hash, manual registration is intended primarily for testing and evaluation scenarios.

> [!Note]
> Customers can only register devices with a hardware hash. Other methods (PKID, tuple) are available through OEMs or CSP partners as described in the previous sections.

## Registering devices

After the hardware hashes have been captured from existing devices, they can be uploaded in any of the following ways:

- [Microsoft Intune](enrollment-autopilot.md). This is the preferred mechanism for all customers.
  - The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center is used for Intune device enrollment.
- [Partner Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/partner-center/autopilot). This is used by CSP partners to register devices on behalf of customers.
- [Microsoft 365 Business & Office 365 Admin](https://support.office.com/article/Create-and-edit-AutoPilot-profiles-5cf7139e-cfa1-4765-8aad-001af1c74faa). This is typically used by small and medium businesses (SMBs) who manage their devices using Microsoft 365 Business.
- [Microsoft Store for Business](/microsoft-store/add-profile-to-devices#manage-autopilot-deployment-profiles). You might already be using MSfB to manage your apps and settings.

A summary of each platform's capabilities is provided below.<br>
