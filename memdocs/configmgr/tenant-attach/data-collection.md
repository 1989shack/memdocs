# Tenant attach data collection

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!-- 6505626 -->
When you attach your Configuration Manager site with a Microsoft Intune tenant, the site sends additional data to Microsoft. This article summarizes the data that's sent.

Tenant attach allows the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to be the Configuration Manager console in the cloud. The architecture allows the site to synchronize data to your Intune tenant. You can then query and present data from your on-premises environment in the cloud console in real time without active synchronization. Tenant attach uses a mixture of these methods to provide efficient up-to-date information in the cloud console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft data handling policies are described in the [Microsoft Intune Privacy Statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/intune/microsoft-intune-privacy-statement). We only use your customer data to provide you the services you signed up for.
