# Cloud attach your Configuration Manager environment
<!--9251060-->
Attaching your Configuration Manager environment the the cloud allows you to continue to modernizing and streamlining your management solution. Cloud attach allows you to transform your existing environment without having to worry about a lot of disruption or risk. A Configuration Manager environment is considered cloud attached when it uses at least one of the three primary cloud attach features. You can enable these three features in any order you wish, or all at once.  

- [Tenant attach](#tenant-attach)
- [Endpoint analytics](#endpoint-analytics)
- [Co-management](#co-management)

[Cloud management gateway (CMG)](#bkmk_cmg) is an additional cloud feature that allows you to manage internet-based clients using your established workflows and processes. CMG helps minimize client management traffic through your VPN so that bandwidth is free for business critical traffic.
