## <a name="bkmk_scp"></a> Validate internet access for the service connection point

<!--8565578-->

If you use Desktop Analytics or tenant attach, the service connection point now checks important internet endpoints. These checks help make sure that the cloud-connected services are available. It also helps you troubleshoot issues by quickly determining if network connectivity is a problem.

For more details, review the **EndpointConnectivityCheckWorker.log** file on the service connection point.

There are also the following status messages for the **SMS_SERVICE_CONNECTOR** component:

| Message ID | Severity | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| 11410 | Informational | All checks are successful |
| 11411 | Warning | One or more non-critical failures occurred |
| 11412 | Error | One or more critical failures occurred |

For more information on required internet endpoints, see [Internet access requirements](../../../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md).
