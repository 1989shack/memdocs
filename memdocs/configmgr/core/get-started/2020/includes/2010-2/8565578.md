## <a name="bkmk_scp"></a> Validate internet access for the service connection point

<!--8565578-->

If you use Desktop Analytics or tenant attach, the service connection point now checks important internet endpoints. These checks help make sure that the cloud-connected services are available. It also helps you troubleshoot issues by quickly determining if network connectivity is a problem.

Review the **EndpointConnectivityCheckWorker.log** file on the service connection point. There are also status messages that display component status.

For more information on required internet endpoints, see [Internet access requirements](../../../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md).
