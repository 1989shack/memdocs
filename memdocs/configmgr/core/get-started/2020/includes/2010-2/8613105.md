## <a name="bkmk_rest"></a> Improvements to the administration service

<!--8613105-->

The Configuration Manager REST API, the administration service, requires a secure HTTPS connection. With the previous methods to enable HTTPS, enabling IIS on the SMS Provider was a prerequisite.

Starting in this release, you no longer need to enable IIS on the SMS Provider for the administration service. When you enable the site for enhanced HTTP, it creates a self-signed certificate for the SMS Provider, and automatically binds it without requiring IIS.

For more general information, see [What is the administration service?](../../../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md)
