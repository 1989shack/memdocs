## <a name="bkmk_blmcmg"></a> Improvements to BitLocker management

<!--6979223-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/40176088-support-mbam-bitlocker-management-iis-roles-on-c), you can now manage BitLocker policies and escrow recovery keys over a cloud management gateway (CMG). This change also provides support for BitLocker management via internet-based client management (IBCM) and when you configure the site for enhanced HTTP. There's no change to the setup process for BitLocker management. For more information, see [Deploy BitLocker management](../../../../../protect/deploy-use/bitlocker/deploy-management-agent.md).

If you have either the Helpdesk or Self-Service portals set up, use these portals to validate that clients escrow their keys directly to a management point. For more information, see [Set up BitLocker portals](../../../../../protect/deploy-use/bitlocker/setup-websites.md). Continue to use BitLockerManagementHandler.log to help troubleshoot client communication.
