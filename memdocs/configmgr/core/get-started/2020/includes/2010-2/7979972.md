## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Enhancements to applications in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
<!--7979972, 8227649-->

We've made improvements to [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md). Administrators can now do the following actions for applications in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center:

- **Uninstall** an application
- **Repair** installation of an application
- **Re-evaluate** the application installation status
- **Reinstall** an application has replaced **Retry installation**

Prerequisites for applications:

- All the prerequisites for [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md)
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client
- Targeted clients need to be online
- To uninstall an application:
   - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the uninstall command defined
   - Required deployments of the application can't be targeted to the client
   - The application must currently be installed on the device
- To repair an application:
   - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the repair command defined
   - The application must currently be installed on the device

Permissions needed:

- **Read** permission on **Collection**
   - Apply the permission to both targeted device collections and targeted user collections
- **Read** on the **Application**
- **Approve** on the **Application**

### Known issues
<!--8699417-->
In this technical preview, the re-evaluate, uninstall, and repair actions only work if the client used a self-signed certificate during registration. If the client registered using a PKI certificate or with Azure Active Directory, these actions won't work.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.
