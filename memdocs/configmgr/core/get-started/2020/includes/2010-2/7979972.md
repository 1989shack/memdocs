## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Enhancements to applications in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
<!--7979972-->

We've made improvements to [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md). Administrators can now perform the following actions for applications in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center:

- Uninstall an application
- Reinstall an application
- Re-evaluate the application installation status
- Install application groups for a single device
