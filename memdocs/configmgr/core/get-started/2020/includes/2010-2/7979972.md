## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Enhancements to applications in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
<!--7979972, 8227649-->

We've made improvements to [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md). Administrators can now do the following actions for applications in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center:

- **Uninstall** an application
- **Repair** installation of an application
- **Re-evaluate** the application installation status
- **Reinstall** an application has replaced **Retry installation**

Prerequisites for applications:

- All the prerequisites for [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md)
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client
- Targeted clients need to be online
- To uninstall an application:
   - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the uninstall command defined
   - Required deployments of the application can't be targeted to the client
- To repair an application:
   - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the repair command defined

Permissions needed:

- **Read** permission on **Collection**
   - Apply the permission to both targeted device collections and targeted user collections
- **Read** on the **Application**
- **Approve** on the **Application**

### Try it out!
