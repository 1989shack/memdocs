## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Improvements to available apps via CMG

<!--7033501-->

An internet-based, domain-joined device that isn't joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and communicates via a cloud management gateway (CMG) can now get apps deployed as available. The Active Directory domain user of the device needs a matching Azure AD identity. When the user starts Software Center, Windows prompts them to enter their Azure AD credentials. They can then see any available apps.
