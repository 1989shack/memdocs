## <a name="bkmk_osdcmg"></a> Improvements to task sequences via CMG

This release includes the following improvements to deploy task sequences to devices that communicate via a cloud management gateway (CMG):

- Support for OS deployment<!-- 6997525 -->: With a task sequence that uses a boot image to deploy an OS, you can deploy it to a device that communicates via CMG. The user needs to start the task sequence from Software Center.

- Support for enhanced HTTP and token authentication<!-- 6983320 -->: This release fixes the two [known issues](../../../../servers/deploy/install/release-notes.md#task-sequences-cant-run-over-cmg) from Configuration Manager current branch version 2002.
