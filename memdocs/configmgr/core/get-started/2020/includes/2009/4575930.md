## <a name="bkmk_remctrl"></a> Improvements to remote control

<!--4575930-->

This release continues to improve the functionality of remote control as first introduced in [technical preview version 1906](../../../2019/technical-preview-1906.md#remote-control-anywhere-using-cloud-management-gateway). You can now connect to any Configuration Manager client with an online status.

The following prerequisites now apply:

- In the **Remote Tools** group of client settings:

  - Enable remote control

  - Add the user as a permitted viewer for remote control.

  For more information, see [About client settings - Remote Tools](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#remote-tools).

- Configuration Manager client requirements:

  - Update the client to the latest version.

  - The client status needs to be online.

  - If the client is internet-based, use a [cloud management gateway (CMG)](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway.md). Then configure the client with one of the following authentication methods:

    - A valid PKI [client certificate](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway.md#bkmk_clientauth)
    - [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../../../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-cmg-azure.md)
    - [Token-based authentication](../../../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-cmg-token.md)

For more information on how to use remote control, see [the instructions from version 1906](../../../2019/technical-preview-1906.md#connect-to-a-client-from-the-console).
