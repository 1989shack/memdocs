## <a name="bkmk_cmgvmss"></a> Cloud management gateway with virtual machine scale set

<!--3601040-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/17404900-cloud-management-gateway-as-csp), cloud management gateway (CMG) deployments now use virtual machine scale sets in Azure. This change introduces support for Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions.

When you create a CMG in the Configuration Manager console, the default option to deploy the cloud service is as a **Virtual machine scale set**. If necessary, you can still select **Cloud service (classic)** to use the existing Azure Resource Manager deployment.

For a CMG deployment to a virtual machine scale set, the service name is different. This name is from the [CMG server authentication certificate](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway.md#bkmk_serverauth).

- With the previous Azure Resource Manager deployment option, the service name is in the **cloudapp.net** domain. For example, **GraniteFalls.CloudApp.Net**.

- With a virtual machine scale set, the service name uses the **cloudapp.azure.com** domain along with the region. For example, **GraniteFalls.EastUS.CloudApp.Azure.Com** for a deployment in the **East US** Azure region.

Otherwise, the configuration, operation, and functionality of the CMG remains the same.

If you have an existing CMG deployment using Azure Resource Manager, you don't have to [redeploy the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway#redeploy-the-service). This deployment method is primarily for CSP customers to use CMG. If you do redeploy the service, since the service name changes, you also need a new CMG server authentication certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> The CMG connection point only communicates with the virtual machine scale set in Azure over HTTPS. It doesn't require TCP-TLS ports 10140-10155 to build the CMG communication channel.

For more general information on the cloud management gateway, see [Plan for the CMG](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway.md).

### Known issues for CMG with virtual machine scale sets

The following CMG configurations are currently not supported in this release:
