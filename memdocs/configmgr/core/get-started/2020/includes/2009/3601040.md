## <a name="bkmk_cmgvmss"></a> Cloud management gateway with virtual machine scale set

<!--3601040-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/17404900-cloud-management-gateway-as-csp), cloud management gateway (CMG) deployments now use virtual machine scale sets in Azure. This change introduces support for Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions.

When you create a CMG in the Configuration Manager console, the option to use an Azure Resource Manager deployment is now replaced by the option to deploy the cloud service as a **Virtual machine scale set**. Otherwise the configuration, operation, and functionality of the CMG remains the same.

If you have an existing CMG deployment using Azure Resource Manager, you don't have to [redeploy the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway#redeploy-the-service). This deployment method allows CSP customers to use CMG.

### Known issues for CMG with virtual machine scale sets

The following CMG configurations are currently not supported in this release:

- Azure US Government Cloud

- Enforce TLS 1.2
