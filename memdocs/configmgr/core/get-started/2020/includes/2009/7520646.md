## Notifications for devices no longer receiving updates
<!--7520646-->
To help you manage security risk in your environment, you'll be notified in-console about devices with operating systems that are past the end of support date and that are no longer eligible to receive security updates. Additionally, a new **Management Insights** rule was added to detect Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 without [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates).

Environments with the following operating systems installed on client devices receive a notification:

- [Windows 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-7) and [Windows Server 2008 (non-Azure)](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2008) without ESU.
- Versions of Windows 10 Semi-Annual Channel that are past the end-of-support date.
   - [Enterprise and Education](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education)
   - [Home and Pro](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro)

Selecting **More info** on the notification for Windows 10 takes you to the **Simplified Management** group in **Management Insights**. Review the **Update clients to a supported Windows 10 version** rule. The rule shows clients running Windows 10 versions that are no longer supported or will reach end of service within the next three months.
