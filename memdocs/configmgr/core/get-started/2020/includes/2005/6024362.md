## Tenant attach: CMPivot

Bring the power of CMPivot and real-time queries to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to be able to run CMPivot from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device. This gives all the traditional benefits of CMPivot, which allows IT Admins and other designated personas the ability to quickly assess the state of devices in their environment and take action.
