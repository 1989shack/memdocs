## <a name="bkmk_alertkey"></a> Notification for Azure AD app secret key expiration

<!--6386392-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492/suggestions/40438012), if you [Configure Azure services](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md) to cloud-attach your site, the Configuration Manager console now displays notifications for the following circumstances:

- One or more Azure AD app secret keys will expire soon
- One or more Azure AD app secret keys have expired

To mitigate both cases, use the in-console action to [Renew secret the key](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#bkmk_renew).

### <a name="ki_console"></a> Known issue: Console may unexpectedly close
<!--7329690-->
This issue only applies if you connect your site to an Azure cloud service that requires registering an app in Azure AD. If the app's secret key expiration date is within 15 days, the notification can cause the console to unexpectedly close. To work around this issue, [Renew secret the key](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#bkmk_renew), and restart the Configuration Manager console.
