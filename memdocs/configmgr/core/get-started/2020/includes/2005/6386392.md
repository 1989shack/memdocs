## <a name="bkmk_alertkey"></a> Notification for Azure AD app secret key expiration

<!--6386392-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492/suggestions/40438012), if you [Configure Azure services](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md) to cloud-attach your site, the Configuration Manager console now displays notifications for the following circumstances:

- One or more Azure AD app secret keys will expire soon
- One or more Azure AD app secret keys have expired

To mitigate both cases, use the in-console action to [Renew secret the key](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#bkmk_renew).
