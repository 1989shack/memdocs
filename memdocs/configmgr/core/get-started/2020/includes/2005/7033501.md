## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Improvements to available apps via CMG

<!--7033501-->

An internet-based device that isn't joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and communicates via a cloud management gateway (CMG) can now get apps deployed as available. The user of the device still needs an Azure AD identity. When the user starts Software Center, Windows prompts them to enter their Azure AD credentials. They can then see any available apps.

This release also fixes an issue with Software Center, which can fail when it uses Windows authentication to get the list of user available apps via the CMG. It now uses Azure AD identity.<!-- 6935376 -->
