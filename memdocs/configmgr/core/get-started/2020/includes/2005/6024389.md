## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Tenant attach: Install an application for an uploaded device

You can now initiate an application install in real-time for a tenant attached device from the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- A [tenant attached environment with uploaded devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).
- enable the optional feature **Approve application requests for users per device**. For more information, see [Enable optional features from updates](../../../../servers/manage/install-in-console-updates.md#bkmk_options).

#### Deploy application

1. Deploy at least one application to a device collection with the **An administrator must approve a request for this application on the device** option set on the deployment. For more information, see [Approve applications](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/app-approval#bkmk_opt).
   - User targeted applications or applications without the approval option set don't appear in the application list.
