## <a name="bkmk_scripts"></a> Tenant attach: Run Scripts from the admin center

Bring the power of the Configuration Manager on-premises Run Scripts feature to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to run PowerShell scripts from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device. This gives all the traditional benefits of PowerShell scripts that have already been defined and approved by the Configuration Manager admin to this new environment.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).
- Configuration Manager clients must be running the latest version client
- To run PowerShell scripts, the client must be running PowerShell version 3.0 or later.
   - If a script you run contains functionality from a later version of PowerShell, the client on which you run the script must be running that later version of PowerShell.
- To use scripts, you must be a member of the appropriate Configuration Manager security role. For more information, see [Security scopes for run scripts](/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md#bkmk_ScriptRoles).
- To run scripts - Your account must have **Run Script** permissions for **Collections**.
- Only scripts that are already created and approved appear in the admin center. For more information on approving scripts, see [Approve or deny a script](/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md##run-script-authors-and-approvers).

#### Run a script

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://devicemanagement.microsoft.com), select a tenant attached device from **Devices** > **All devices**.
1. Select **Scripts**, then select one of your scripts. If needed, you can search by script name.
1. Click **Run script** from the page that appears on the right.
   - You'll be notified your script has started. The **Run script** button will be disabled until it's complete.
1. When the script completes, the results will show in the **Output** pane.
   - You can copy the text of the script output.
