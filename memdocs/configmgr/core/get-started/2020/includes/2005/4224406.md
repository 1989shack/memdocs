## <a name="bkmk_deeplink"></a> Directly link to Configuration Manager Community hub items

<!--4224406-->

You can now easily navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console Community hub node with a direct link. For easier collaboration, share links to Community hub items with your colleagues.

For example, to share the **Configure Edge Auto Update** script, use the following link: `mem-console:nav=CommunityNode/Hub&item=7200`. If you have the technical preview branch version 2005 console installed, launch the console directly to the [Configure Edge Auto Update script](mem-console:nav=CommunityNode/Hub&item=7200).

> [!NOTE]
> These deep links are currently only for items in the Community hub node of the console.
