## <a name="bkmk_deeplink"></a> Directly link to Configuration Manager Community hub items

<!--4224406-->

You can now easily navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console Community hub node with a direct link. For easier collaboration, share links to Community hub items with your colleagues.

For example, use this link to share the [Configure Edge Auto Update script](https://communityhub.microsoft.com/item/7200) (`https://communityhub.microsoft.com/item/7200`). If you have the technical preview branch version 2005 console installed, follow that link, and then select **Launch the Community hub**. The console opens directly to the script in the Community hub.

> [!NOTE]
> These deep links are currently only for items in the Community hub node of the console.
