## <a name="bkmk_deeplink"></a> Directly link to Configuration Manager Community hub items

<!--4224406-->

You can now easily navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console Community hub node with a direct link. For easier collaboration, share links to Community hub items with your colleagues.

For example, to share the **Configure Edge Auto Update** script, use [aka.ms/CommunityhubTP](https://aka.ms/CommunityhubTP). If you have the technical preview branch version 2005 console installed, follow that aka.ms link, and then select **Launch the Community hub**. The console opens directly to the script in the Community hub.

> [!NOTE]
> These deep links are currently only for items in the Community hub node of the console.
>
> The aka.ms link is for the purposes of demonstration. The specific implementation for sharing links may change in the future.
