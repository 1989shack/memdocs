## <a name="bkmk_pwsh7"></a> Support for PowerShell version 7

<!--6023299-->

The Configuration Manager PowerShell cmdlet library now offers preliminary support for PowerShell 7. PowerShell 7 support is in preview, and isn't intended for use in production environments. If you have any problems using Configuration Manager cmdlets with PowerShell 7, [send feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) from the Configuration Manager console to report it.

For more information on PowerShell 7, including directions on how to download and install it, see [Install PowerShell on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7).

### Known issues

- You currently can't launch PowerShell 7 directly from the Configuration Manager console. Manually start PowerShell 7, and then [import the Configuration Manager module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sccm/overview?view=sccm-ps#import-the-configuration-manager-powershell-module).

- Configuration Manager cmdlets with **Import-** and **Export-** verbs may not function as expected.
