## <a name="bkmk_mem"></a> Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details
<!--6374854, 6521921-->

You can now see client details including collections, boundary group membership, and real-time client information for a specific device in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

> [!Important]
> - This is a preview experience. The final location will be the devices blade in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.
> - The boundary groups tab functions only for stand alone sites. The tab will be empty in the admin center for anything other than a standalone primary site.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).
- One of the following browsers:
  - Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later
  - Google Chrome
- The user account has been discovered with both [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc) and [Active Directory user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser).
  - Meaning the user account needs to be a synced user object in Azure.

#### Permissions

The user account needs the following permissions:

- The **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- The **Admin User** role for the Configuration Manager Microservice application in Azure AD.
  - Add the role in Azure AD from **Enterprise applications** > **Configuration Manager Microservice** > **Users and groups** > **Add user**. Groups are supported if you have Azure AD premium.

#### View ConfigMgr client details

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace and select the **Devices** node.
1. Right-click on a device that's been uploaded to Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
1. In the right-click menu, select **Start** > **Admin Center Preview** to open the preview in your browser.
     - This launch is a preview experience. The final location will be in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Note the following behaviors for some of the client details:
>
> - The primary site updates the following fields once an hour: **Last policy request**, **Last active time**, and **Last management point**
>
> - To populate the **Logged on user** field, at least one user needs to sign in to the device after you install the Configuration Manager client
