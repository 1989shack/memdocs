## <a name="bkmk_osdpart"></a> Improvement to **Format and partition disk** task sequence step

<!--6610288-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/34167106-disk-number-variable-for-format-and-partition-disk), you can use a task sequence variable to specify the target of the **Format and partition disk** step. This new variable option supports more complex task sequences with dynamic behaviors. For example, a custom script can detect the disk and set the variable based on the hardware type. Then you can use one instance of this step to configure different hardware types.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> You can still use the existing task sequence variable **OSDDiskIndex**. It's value 
 -->
In the properties of the step, select the new option **Variable name to store disk number**, and enter a custom variable name. The value of this variable should be an integer value for the physical disk.
