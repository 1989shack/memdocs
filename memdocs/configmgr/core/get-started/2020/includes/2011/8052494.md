## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Categorize Community hub content

<!--8052494, 8625943, 8717639 -->
Community hub content is grouped into a Microsoft, curated, or unreviewed category to allow admins to choose the types of content their environment displays. Admins can choose from the different categories of content that are provided in the Community hub to match their risk profile and their willingness to share and use content from those outside Microsoft and outside their own company.

Community hub content has three categories:
- **Microsoft**: Content provided by Microsoft
- **Curated**: Content provided by the community which gets reviewed by Microsoft
- **Unreviewed**: General content from the community that doesn't get reviewed by Microsoft

You choose the types of content your environment displays from the following options:

- **Display Microsoft content**: Selecting this option means that only content created by Microsoft will be shown in the Community hub. This content has had some basic testing and scanning validation to confirm no malware and inappropriate text.
- **Display Microsoft and curated community content**: Show curated content from both Microsoft and community partners with basic level of review. Selecting this option means that only content that has been curated will be shown. The curation process includes basic review to confirm that the content doesn’t have malware and inappropriate text, but hasn’t necessarily been tested. It will include content from the community, not just from Microsoft.
- **Display all content including unreviewed content**:  Selecting this option means that all content is shown. This option includes unreviewed open source type samples from the community, meaning that the content hasn’t necessarily been reviewed at all. It's provided as-is as open source type sample content. Doing your own inspection and testing before using is highly encouraged, which is good practice on any content, but especially this class of content.

Since the content is *open source* style content, admins should always review what is provided before consuming it. The new curation process is intended to vet the material to make sure there aren't obvious quality or compliance issues, but it will be somewhat of a cursory review. Content stored within GitHub and accessed from the Community hub isn’t supported by Microsoft. Microsoft doesn’t validate content collected from or shared by the general community. For more information, see [GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/terms) and [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/privacy).

#### Prerequisites


Scenario requested to run: Select the "Display Microsoft Content" in Community hub section of the Hierarchy settings, go to Community hub and ensure only Microsoft content is available. Go back and select one of the other settings, such as "Display all content, including unreviewed content" and then go to the Community hub and see that more content is displayed from Community partners, not just Microsoft. Confirm that only the type of content is displayed and able to be downloaded from the Community hub, that matches the corresponding hierarchy setting category.
