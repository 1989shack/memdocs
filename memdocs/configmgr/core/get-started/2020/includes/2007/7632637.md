## <a name="bkmk_font"></a> Fixed-width font now used in some console areas

<!--7632637-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492/suggestions/40824247), various areas in the Configuration Manager console now use the fixed-width font Consolas. This font provides consistent spacing and makes it easier to read. In this release, you'll see the Consolas font in the following places:

- Application scripts
- Configuration item scripts
- WMI-based collection membership queries
- CMPivot queries
- Scripts

If there are other console areas that should use this font, send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback).
