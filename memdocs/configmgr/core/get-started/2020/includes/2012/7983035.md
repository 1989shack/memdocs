## <a name="bkmk_hubapp"></a> Community hub support for application content

<!--7983035-->

You can now download content for Windows Installer apps in the [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md). This improvement helps app providers to easily share a fully functional app with the Configuration Manager community.

When you download an app with content from the hub, it downloads both the app metadata and the MSI. The hub first prompts you for a download location. Specify a network path for the site to use as the content source. After the console downloads the file, it validates the hash. This check makes sure the content didn't change during download. It then validates the digital signature on the MSI file. If it can't verify the signature, it prompts you if you still want to import the file.

To help you test this new feature, the [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)](/mem/configmgr/mdt/) is now available as an app with content in the Community hub.
