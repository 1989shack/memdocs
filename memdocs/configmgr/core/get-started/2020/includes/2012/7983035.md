## <a name="bkmk_hubapp"></a> Community hub support for application content

<!--7983035-->

You can now download content for Windows Installer apps in the [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md). This improvement helps app providers to easily share a fully functional app with the Configuration Manager community.

When you download an app with content from the hub, it downloads both the app metadata and the MSI. The hub first prompts you for a download location. Specify a network path for the site to use as the content source. After the console downloads the file, it validates the hash. This check makes sure the content didn't change during download. It then validates the digital signature on the MSI file. If it can't verify the signature, it prompts you if you still want to import the file.

To help you test this new feature, the [System Center Updates Publisher](../../../../../sum/tools/updates-publisher.md) is available as an app with content in the Community hub.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Community** workspace, and select the **Hub**.
1. Search for the app **System Center Updates Publisher**.
1. Select **Download**.
1. Specify a network path for the site to use as the content source.

After the hub downloads the app, use the following steps to verify the app:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, and select the **Applications** node.
1. Find the new application for **System Center Updates Publisher**.
1. To view the new Windows Installer deployment type, in the Details pane, switch to the **Deployment Types** tab.
1. To see the MSI downloaded from the Community hub, browse to the network path.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to install this app, make sure to review the [prerequisites and installation instructions](../../../../../sum/tools/install-updates-publisher.md).
