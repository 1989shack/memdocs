## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot_hub"></a> Access the top queries shared in the Community hub from CMPivot
<!--7137169-->

You can now access the top CMPivot queries shared in the Community hub from on-premises CMPivot. By leveraging pre-created CMPivot queries shared by the broader community, CMPivot users gain access to a wider variety of queries. On-premises CMPivot accesses the Community hub and returns a list of the top downloaded CMPivot queries which users are able to review then run on-demand.

Prerequisites:
- Enable [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md)
   - You don't need a GitHub account to download content.
- Verify which [content categories are displayed](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_category) for Community hub
- Meet all of the [CMPivot prerequisites and permissions](/servers/manage/cmpivot.md#prerequisites)

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Go to 
Scenario(s) instructions (with screenshots):
Go to the CMPivot UI (either in the Admin Console or in the [CMPivot standalone](../../../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md#bkmk_standalone) (.msi) installation.
For example, from a device collection, start CMPivot. There will now be a new Community hub link/icon on the menu.
Select that and you will be presented with a list of CMPivot queries that have been created by the community and shared in the Community hub.
Users can now double click and select from those pre-created queries and use them and customize them further for their own needs. This now gives a wider selection of queries for immediate usage without having to construct them and also allows information sharing on how to build queries for future reference.

1. Go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace then select the **Device Collections** node.
1. Select a target collection, target device, or group of devices then click **Start CMPivot** in the ribbon to launch the tool.
   - Optionally, launch the [CMPivot standalone](../../../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md#bkmk_standalone) (.msi) installation.
1. There will now be a new Community hub link/icon on the menu.


1. Keep the CMPivot window open to view results from clients. When you close the CMPivot window, the session is complete.
   - If the query has been sent, then clients still send a state message response to the server.
