## <a name="bkmk_implicit"></a> Improvements to implicit uninstall

<!--12488148-->

If you deploy an application or app group to a security group-based collection, and you enable [implicit uninstall](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/uninstall-applications.md#implicit-uninstall), starting in this release, changes to the security group are now honored. When you change the membership of the security group, Configuration Manager uninstalls the app for the resource that you removed from the security group.
