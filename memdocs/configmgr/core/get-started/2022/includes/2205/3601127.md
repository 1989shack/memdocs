## <a name="bkmk_anchor"></a> Improvements to monthly maintenance window reoccurence schedule with Offset (in days)
<!--3601127#-->

Based upon your feedback, we can now have an offset to the monthly maintenance window schedule in days to align deployments with patch tuesdays.. For example, an offset of two days after the second Tuesday of the month sets maintance window on Thursday.
