## <a name="bkmk_anchor"></a> Offset for monthly maintenance window reoccurrence schedule.
<!--3601127#-->

Based upon your feedback, we can now have an offset to the monthly maintenance window schedule in days to align deployments with monthly security updates. For example, an offset of two days after the second Tuesday of the month sets maintenance window on Thursday.

### Try it out!  
 Try to complete the tasks. Then send **Feedback** from the **Home** tab of the ribbon letting us know how it worked. 

**Create a custom schedule that sets maintenance window offset from a base day**

1. In the **Device Collection** workspace, create **New Collection**, and select **Properties**.
2. Select on **Maintenance Window** and choose **New Custom Schedule**. 
3. For the custom schedule, select **Monthly** and put in a base day such as the second Tuesday. 
4. Verify the **Offset (days)** and the number of days for the offset then **OK** when finished.  
5. Complete the deployment as usual.
