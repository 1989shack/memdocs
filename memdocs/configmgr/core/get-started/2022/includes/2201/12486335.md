## <a name="bkmk_tsico"></a> Support for task sequence and package icons

<!--12486335-->

Based on your feedback, you can now add custom icons for task sequences and legacy packages. These icons appear in Software Center when you deploy these objects. Instead of a default icon, a custom icon can improve the user experience to better identify the software.

> [!NOTE]
> With this change, the task sequence property page for **Performance** is renamed to **More Options**.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. If needed, [create a task sequence](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/manage-task-sequences-to-automate-tasks.md) or [create a package and program](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs.md#create-a-package-and-program).

1. Open the properties of a task sequence or package.

1. Switch to the **More Options** tab.

1. In the section for the icon, select **Browse**. Select an icon from the default shell library, or browse to another file.

    - Supported files are programs (`.exe`), libraries (`.dll`), or icons (`.ico`).
    - Icons can have pixel dimensions of up to 512x512.

After you save the properties, deploy the task sequence or package, if it's not already deployed. For more information, see one of the following articles:

- [Deploy a task sequence](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/deploy-a-task-sequence.md)
- [Deploy packages and programs](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs.md#deploy-packages-and-programs)

When clients receive the deployment policy, they'll display the icon in Software Center.
