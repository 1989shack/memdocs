Based on your feedback, weâ€™ve made a few improvements to the console and user experience.

- When using temporary device nodes, device actions like **Run Scripts** are now available to make the experience in the console consistent.
- Additional Management Insights rules now have click-through actions
- Copy/paste is available for more objects from details panes.
   - Added the **Name** property in the details pane for configuration items, configuration item related policies, and applications
- Company portal no longer displays an available package as a featured application
