## <a name="bkmk_implicit"></a> App groups support implicit uninstall

<!--10479618-->

Now when you deploy an [application group](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-app-groups.md) as required to a device or user collection, you can specify that it automatically uninstalls when the resource is removed from the collection.

For more general information on this feature, see [Implicit uninstall](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/uninstall-applications.md#implicit-uninstall).
