## <a name="bkmk_health"></a> Improvements to client health dashboard

<!--5728069-->

This release includes improvements to the [Client health dashboard](../../../../clients/manage/monitor-clients.md#bkmk_health).

- The dashboard includes a new tile for **Health trends by scenario**. It shows the percentage of healthy clients for the selected scenario. The following example shows the trend for hardware inventory for the past 31 days:

- Configure the period of time for this tile in **Client Status Settings**. Select the **Client Status** node, and then select **Client Status Settings** in the ribbon. This tile uses the setting, **Retain client status history for the following number of days**, which is `31` days by default.

- While you can configure the dashboard to limit the view by collection, previously it would reset to the **All Systems** collection when you refreshed the node. You can now select the ribbon action to **Choose Default Collection**, which sets a persistent user preference.
