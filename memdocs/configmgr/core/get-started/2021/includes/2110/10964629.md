## <a name="bkmk_attach"></a> Simplified cloud attach configuration
<!--10964629-->
We've simplified the process to cloud attach your Configuration Manager environment. You can now choose to use a streamlined set of recommended defaults when cloud attaching your environment. By using the recommended default settings, your eligible devices will be cloud attached and you'll enable capabilities like rich analytics, cloud console, and real-time device querying. The default settings include the following features:

- Automatically enroll all eligible devices into Intune
    - Enrolls your clients into [co-management](../../../../../comanage/tutorial-co-manage-clients.md), with all [workloads](../../../../../comanage/workloads.md) pointed to Configuration Manager
- Automatically uploads all your site's devices to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center
    - Enables [tenant attach](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md) for all eligible devices
- Enables [Endpoint analytics](../../../../../../analytics/scores.md)
