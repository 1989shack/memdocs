## <a name="bkmk_ext"></a> Hierarchy approved console extensions don't require signing
<!--9761129-->
Starting in this technical preview, you can choose to allow unsigned [hierarchy approved console extensions](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md). You may need to allow unsigned console extensions due to an unsigned internally developed extension, or for testing your own custom extension in a lab.

To allow unsigned hierarchy approved console extensions:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select **Sites**.
1. Select **Hierarchy Settings** from the ribbon.
1. On the **General** tab, enable the **Hierarchy approved console extensions can be unsigned** option.
1. Select **Ok** when done to close the **Hierarchy Settings Properties**.
