## <a name="bkmk_wu"></a> Windows Update native experience for software updates
<!--4316341-->
When installing software updates from Configuration Manager, you can now choose to use the native Windows Update interface and restart experience. The client's Windows Update Settings page will display the updates like they appear when using Windows Update for scanning. Restarts from software updates will also behave as though you're using Windows Update. To use this feature, client devices must be running [Windows Insider build 21277 or later](/windows-insider/active-dev-branch#build-21277). To enable the Windows Update native experience:

1. From the **Administration** workspace, select **Client Settings** in Configuration Manager.
1. Select the **Computer Restart** group in **Client Settings**
1. For the **Select the restart experience to be shows to end users** setting, choose the **Windows** option.
