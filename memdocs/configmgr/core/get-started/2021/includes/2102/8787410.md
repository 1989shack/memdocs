## <a name="bkmk_colleval"></a> Improvements to collection evaluation view
<!--8787410-->
The following improvements were made to the collection evaluation view:
- The central administration site (CAS) now displays a summary of collection evaluation status for all the primary sites in the hierarchy
- Drill through from collection evaluation status queue to a collection
- Copy text to the clipboard from the collection evaluation page
- Configure the refresh interval for the collection evaluation statistics page

### Collection evaluation status at the CAS

Since collection evaluation happens at the primary site level, the collection evaluation view on the CAS is a summary of what's occurring on the primary sites. 

There are two new tabs in the details pane of the collection view in the console. The following new tabs show collection evaluation information from all primary sites in hierarchy:

- **Evaluation (Full) In Hierarchy**
- **Evaluation (Incremental) In Hierarchy**

From the **Device Collections** node at the CAS, the evaluation columns display the evaluation status from the primary site with the longest run time. The column information at the CAS for the full evaluation status could be from a different primary site than the incremental information since the longest runtime for the incremental might have occurred at a different primary.

 For instance, incremental evaluation for the `All Systems` collection on the  `WMII` primary site takes longer than the other primary sites. The full evaluation columns on the CAS display the information from primary site `WMI` for the `All Systems` collection in the **Device Collections** node.

### Drill through from collection evaluation status queue to a collection

You can now navigate to a collection in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace from the collection evaluation queue status view in the **Monitoring** workspace. Select a collection from one of the queues, then choose **View collection** from the ribbon or right-click menu to open the collection. Navigation to the collection won't occur if the collection evaluation hasn't yet completed.

### Configure refresh interval for the collection evaluation statistics page

You can configure a primary site's refresh interval for the **Collection Evaluation** statistics page to be between 1 minute and 1440 minutes (1 day). Typically collection evaluation occurs over the course of seconds or minutes. However, you can change the statistics refresh to accommodate your environment. The default refresh interval is 5 minutes.

### Copy text to clipboard from collection evaluation statistics page

You can copy collection evaluation statistics as structured text to the clipboard. Use the **Copy** button in the ribbon to copy the statistics.
