## <a name="bkmk_cmgsize"></a> Select VM size for CMG

<!--3555749-->

When you deploy a cloud management gateway (CMG) with a [virtual machine scale set](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway.md#virtual-machine-scale-sets), you can now choose the virtual machine (VM) size. The following three options are available:

- **Lab**: [B2s](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable)
- **Standard**: [A2_v2](/azure/virtual-machines/av2-series). This option continues to be the default setting.
- **Large**: [D2_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series)

This control gives you greater flexibility with your CMG deployment. You can adjust the size for test labs or if you support large environments. For example, the smaller B2s VM is ideal for a smaller number of clients at less cost. For more information on how these options differ in cost for your region, see the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

For more general information on the CMG, see [CMG overview](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/overview.md).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Set up a CMG](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway.md) with a virtual machine scale set.

1. [Modify the CMG](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/modify-cloud-management-gateway.md).

1. Switch to the **Settings** tab. By default, the CMG deploys with the **Standard (A2_V2)** size.

1. Change the **VM Size** to **Lab (B2s)**.

1. Select **OK** to save the change.

Configuration Manager redeploys the service in Azure to use the new VM size.
