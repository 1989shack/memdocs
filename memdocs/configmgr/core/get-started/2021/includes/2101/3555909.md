## <a name="bkmk_extensions"></a> Console extension installation
<!--3555909-->
You can now download console extensions from the [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md) and have it applied to all consoles connected to a hierarchy. This improvement allows you to start managing the approval and installation of console extensions used in your environment. In this technical preview, only [Right Click Tools (Community Edition) from Recast Software](https://www.recastsoftware.com/right-click-tools) is available for download and installation.

### About the Console Extensions node

A new node has been added to the Configuration Manager console. The **Console Extensions** node is located under **Administration** > **Overview** > **Updates and Servicing**. Console extensions downloaded from the community hub will be located here. The following actions are grouped in the ribbon and the right-click menu:

#### Actions for All Sites group
- **Approve Installation**: Approves the console extension for installation across all sites. An extension must be approved before notifications are enabled.
- **Revoke Approval**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the ***Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy upon the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Allows for re-approval of the extension at a later date.
- **Enable Notifications**: Upon next launch of the console, notifies users within the security scope that the extension can be installed.
- **Disable Notifications**: Disables the console notification messages for the extension. Users within the security scope can still install approved extensions from the **Console Extensions** node.  
- **Delete**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the **Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy upon the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Removes the extension from the **Console Extensions** node so it can't be re-approved later.

#### Classify group

- **Set Security Scopes**: Set the [security scopes](../../../../understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md#bkmk_PlanScope) to secure the object and limit which administrative users have access.
#### Local Extension group

- **Install**: Installs the selected extension from the local console
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalls the selected extension from the local console
