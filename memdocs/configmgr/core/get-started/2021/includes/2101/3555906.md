## <a name="bkmk_futs"></a> Deploy feature update with an in-place upgrade task sequence

<!--3555906-->

You can now upgrade a client's Windows OS by using a feature update deployed with a task sequence.

### Prerequisites for feature update in task sequence

- Synchronize the software update point to include the **Upgrade** classification. For more information, see [Configure classifications and products](../../../../../sum/get-started/configure-classifications-and-products.md).

- For a deployment package that contains the feature update, distribute it to a distribution point that the client can access. For more information, see [Download software updates](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/download-software-updates.md).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Create a task sequence to upgrade an OS](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/create-a-task-sequence-to-upgrade-an-operating-system.md).
