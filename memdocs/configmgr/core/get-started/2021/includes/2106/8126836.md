## <a name="bkmk_rbac"></a> Intune role-based access control for tenant attach
<!--8126836, 6415648, 8348644-->
Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center can now be leveraged as the role-based access control (RBAC) authority. When using Intune as the RBAC authority, Intune RBAC now becomes the authority for access management of the tenant attach blades.  

### Known issues
<!--9960664-->

For this technical preview, we will always do an Intune RBAC check. If the check box is not checked for this tech preview and user is not SCCM administrator, the incoming request from the Intune console will be rejected since only Intune RBAC was set for the helpdesk operator.

In case both Intune and SCCM RBAC were specified, the request will be processed as expected when the checkbox is checked.
