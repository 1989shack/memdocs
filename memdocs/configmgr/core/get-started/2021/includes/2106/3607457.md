## <a name="bkmk_uninstall"></a> Implicit uninstall of applications

<!--3607457-->

Many customers have lots of collections because for every application they need at least two collections: one for install and another for uninstall. This practice adds overhead of managing more collections, and can reduce site performance for collection evaluation.

Starting in this release, you can enable an application deployment to support implicit uninstall. If a device is in a collection, the application installs. Then when you remove the device from the collection, the application uninstalls.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Add a device to a collection](../../../../clients/manage/manage-clients.md#add-selected-items). This action typically involves creating a direct membership rule for the device.

1. [Deploy an application](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md) to that device collection.

1. On the Deployment Settings page of the Deploy Software Wizard, configure the following options:

    - **Action**: Install

    - **Purpose**: Required

    - Enable **Uninstall this application if the targeted object falls out of the collection**

1. Complete the Deploy Software Wizard.

1. [Download computer policy](../../../../clients/manage/manage-clients.md#BKMK_PolicyRetrieval) on the device. Because it's a required deployment, the client installs the app. You can use Software Center to view the installation status. For more information, see the [Software Center user guide](../../../../understand/software-center.md#applications).

1. Remove the device from the collection. This action typically involves removing the direct membership rule for the device from the [collection properties](../../../../clients/manage/collections/manage-collections.md#collection-properties).

1. [Download computer policy](../../../../clients/manage/manage-clients.md#BKMK_PolicyRetrieval) again on the device. Because the device isn't in the installation collection, the client uninstalls the app.

To help you troubleshoot this process, view the **SMS_ImplicitUninstall.log** file on the client.
