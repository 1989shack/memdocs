## <a name="bkmk_pushnotify"></a> External notifications

<!--9504414-->

In a complex IT environment, you may have an automation system like [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview). Customers use these systems to define and control automated workflows to integrate multiple systems. You could integrate Configuration Manager into a separate automation system through the product's SDK APIs. But this process can be complex and challenging for IT professionals without a software development background.

Starting in this release, you can enable the site to send notifications to an external system or application. This feature simplifies the process by using a web service-based method. You configure [subscriptions](../../../../servers/manage/configure-alerts.md) to send these notifications. These notifications are in response to specific, defined events as they occur. For example, [status message filter rules](../../../../servers/manage/use-status-system.md#manage-status-filter-rules).

> [!NOTE]
> The external system or application defines and provides the methods that this feature calls.

When you set up this feature, the site opens a communication channel with the external system. That system can then start a complex workflow or action that doesn't exist in Configuration Manager.

### Prerequisites for external notifications

- The site's service connection point needs to be in online mode. For more information, see [About the service connection point](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md).

- Currently, this feature only supports Azure Logic Apps as the external system.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Create the HTTP request trigger

Create an event trigger in Azure Logic Apps to receive the web request from the service connection point. The request uses the following JSON schema:

``` JSON
{
    "properties": {
        "EventID": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "EventName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "EventPayload": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "MessageID": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "ServerName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "SiteCode": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "Source": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "type": "object"
}
```

#### Create a subscription

(Users also need to enable this feature by creating a subscription through UI/Powershell script.)

#### Create a status message filter rule

(For status messages filter rules, users also need to create a rule with a new action that supports exposing status messages to external systems. This can also be done through UI/Powershell script.)

#### (Do it)

#### Troubleshooting logs

Use the following Configuration Manager log files on the site server to help troubleshoot this process:

- **ExternalNotificationsWorker.log**: Check if the queue has been processed and notifications are sent to external system.
- **statmgr.log**: Check if the status filter rules have been processed without errors
