## <a name="bkmk_adr"></a> Improvements to ADR search criteria
<!--7033309-->

We've added the following options in the **Date released or revised** search criteria for [automatic deployment rules]():

- Older than 30 days
- Older than 60 days
- Older than 90 days
- Older than 180 days
- Older than 365 days

### Known issue

The Configuration Manager console incorrectly lists the new options for 180 and 365 days as 90 days. The list is ordered as follows:

- The first instance of **Older than 90 days** finds updates older than 90 days
- The second instance of **Older than 90 days** finds updates older than 180 days
- The third instance of **Older than 90 days** finds updates older than 365 days
