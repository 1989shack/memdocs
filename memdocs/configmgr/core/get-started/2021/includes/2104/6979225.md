## <a name="bkmk_bitlocker"></a> Tenant attach: BitLocker recovery keys

<!--6979225-->

You can now get BitLocker recovery keys for a [tenant-attached device](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md) from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. For example, a help desk technician who doesn't have access to Configuration Manager could use the web-based admin center to help an end user get a recovery key for their device.

Since this feature is still in preview, you need to access it from the **Admin center preview** option from the Configuration Manager console of the technical preview branch.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Devices** node.

1. Select a device. In the **Device** group on the ribbon, select **Start**, and then select **Admin center preview**. This action opens the preview version of the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center in the default browser.

1. In the admin center preview, select **Recovery key** to display the key for the selected device.
