# What's new in version 2006 of Configuration Manager current branch

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Update 2006 for Configuration Manager current branch is available as an in-console update. Apply this update on sites that run version 1810 or later. <!-- baseline only statement:When installing a new site, it's also available as a baseline version. -->This article summarizes the changes and new features in Configuration Manager, version 2006.

Always review the latest checklist for installing this update. For more information, see [Checklist for installing update 2006](../../servers/manage/checklist-for-installing-update-2006.md).

To take full advantage of new Configuration Manager features, after you update the site, also update clients to the latest version. While new functionality appears in the Configuration Manager console when you update the site and console, the complete scenario isn't functional until the client version is also the latest.
