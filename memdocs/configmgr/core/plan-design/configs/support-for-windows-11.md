# Support for Windows 11 in Configuration Manager  

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Learn about the Windows 11 versions that Configuration Manager supports as a client.

For more information about support for the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 11, see [Support for the Windows ADK](support-for-windows-adk.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can continue to use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage devices running Windows 11 the same as with Windows 10. If another article doesn't explicitly reference Windows 11, assume that feature support for Windows 10 also includes Windows 11. This article lists some [known issues](#known-issues).

<!--
> [!TIP]
> Windows Server builds as a client are supported the same as the associated Windows 11 version. For example, Windows Server 2022 is the same build version as Windows 11 ..., and Windows Server version ... is the same build version as Windows 11, version ....

## Windows 11 versions

Configuration Manager attempts to provide support as a client for each new Windows 11 version soon after it becomes available. Because the products have separate development and release schedules, the support that Configuration Manager provides depends on when each becomes available.

A Configuration Manager version drops from the matrix after [support for that version](../../servers/manage/current-branch-versions-supported.md) ends. Similarly, Configuration Manager doesn't support Windows 11 versions when their support lifecycle ends.

- The latest version of Configuration Manager current branch receives both security and critical updates, which can include fixes for Windows 11-specific features. When Microsoft releases a new version of Configuration Manager current branch, prior versions only receive security updates. For more information, see [Support for Configuration Manager current branch versions](../../servers/manage/current-branch-versions-supported.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The best way to stay current with Windows 11 is to stay current with Configuration Manager. For more information, see [Configuration Manager and Windows as a Service](../../understand/configuration-manager-and-windows-as-service.md).

- This information supplements [Supported operating systems for clients and devices](supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md).

The following table lists the versions of Windows 11 that you can use as a client with different versions of Configuration Manager.

## Support notes

- Support for Windows 11 semi-annual channel versions includes the following editions: Enterprise, Pro, Education, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstation.

## Support for Windows Insider

You can [update and service Windows Insider](../../../sum/get-started/configure-classifications-and-products.md#bkmk_WIfB) builds. This ability is provided as a convenience to our customers. While this functionality should work, its support is best effort. Configuration Manager might not issue a hotfix for this functionality if it doesn't work.

To provide feedback on Windows Insider, use the Windows [Feedback Hub](/windows-insider/business/feedback).

## Known issues

### Desktop Analytics

<!-- 10797955 -->

[Desktop Analytics](../../../desktop-analytics/overview.md) doesn't support Windows 11. For devices running Windows 11, you can't enroll them to Desktop Analytics. Windows 11 won't be available as a target version.

Microsoft recommends that you enable tenant attach and then enable Endpoint analytics for devices uploaded to Microsoft Endpoint Manager. For more information, see [Endpoint analytics](../../../../analytics/overview.md).
