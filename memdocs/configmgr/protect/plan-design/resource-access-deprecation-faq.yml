    questions:
      - question: |
          Will these features be removed from Configuration Manager?
        answer: |
          Yes. In version 2203, these features will no longer be available. If you're actively using these features, don't upgrade to version 2203.

      - question: |
          What functionality is available to replace these features?
        answer: |
          Use Microsoft Intune to deploy resource access profiles. For more information, see [Apply features and settings on your devices using device profiles in Microsoft Intune](../../../intune/configuration/device-profiles.md).

          Use [co-management](../../comanage/overview.md) to enroll Configuration Manager clients to Intune.

      - question: |
          What do I do if I'm deploying wi-fi profiles with Configuration Manager?
        answer: |
          Before you upgrade to Configuration Manager version 2203, [enable co-management](../../comanage/how-to-enable.md), and deploy the same wi-fi profiles with Intune. For more information, see [Add and use Wi-Fi settings on your devices in Microsoft Intune](../../../intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure.md).

      - question: |
          What happens if I don't enable co-management?
        answer: |
          If you upgrade to version 2203, you can't deploy any wi-fi, VPN, Windows Hello for Business, or certificate (SCEP, PFX, or root CA) profiles to Configuration Manager clients. Any existing deployed profiles won't remove from devices. For example, existing wi-fi connections should still function, and certificates won't be removed from Windows.

      - question: |
          What happens if I've enabled co-management, but haven't switched the resource access workload?
        answer: |
          Starting in version 2203, the behavior is the same as the workload switched to Intune.
