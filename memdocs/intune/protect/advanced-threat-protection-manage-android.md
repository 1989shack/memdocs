# Configure Microsoft Defender ATP on Android devices you manage with Intune

When you integrate Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), you can use device configuration profiles to modify some settings of Microsoft Defender ATP on Android devices.

Before preceding, you must successfully [Configure Microsoft Defender ATP in Intune](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md) and onboard Android devices to Microsoft Defender ATP.

## Configure web protection on devices that run Android

By default, Microsoft Defender ATP for Android includes and enables the web protection feature. [Web protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/web-protection-overview) helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks.

While enabled by default, there are valid reasons to disable this protection on some Android devices. For example, you might choose to use only the Microsoft Defender ATP app scan feature, or to prevent web protection from using your VPN while it scans for harmful URLs.

Intune supports turning off all or part of the web protection feature. The method you use and the capabilities you can disable depend on how the Android device is enrolled with Intune:

- **Android device administrator**: Use a configuration profile to set custom OMA-URI settings on the device to disable the entire web protection feature or to disable only the use of VPNs. For general information about custom settings for Android devices, see [Custom settings](../configuration/custom-settings-android.md).

- **Android Enterprise work profile**: Use an app configuration profile and the *configuration designer* to disable web protection. This method and enrollment type support disabling all web protection capabilities but doesn't support disabling only the use of VPNs. For general information about app configuration policies, see [Use the configuration designer](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md#use-the-configuration-designer).

To configure web protection on devices, use the following procedures to create and deploy the applicable configuration.

### Disable web protection for Android device administrator

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.

3. Enter the following settings:

   - **Platform**: Select **Android device administrator**
   - **Profile**: Select **Custom**

   Select **Create**.

4. On **Basics**, enter the following details:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. For example, *Android custom profile for Microsoft Defender ATP web protection*

5. On **Configuration settings**, select **Add**.

   Specify settings for the configuration you want to deploy:

   Select **Add** to save the OMA-URI settings configuration, and then select **Next** to continue.

6. On **Assignments**, specify the groups that will receive this profile. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](../configuration/device-profile-assign.md).
