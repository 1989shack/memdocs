# Endpoint detection and response policy for endpoint security in Intune

When you integrate Defender ATP with Intune, you can use the endpoint security policies for endpoint detection and response (EDR) to manage the EDR settings and onboard devices to Defender ATP.

The capabilities of Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint detection and response provide advanced attack detections that are near real-time and actionable. Security analysts can prioritize alerts effectively, gain visibility into the full scope of a breach, and take response actions to remediate threats.

Find the endpoint security policies for EDR under *Manage* in the **Endpoint security** node of the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

View [settings for Endpoint detection and response profiles](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-profile-settings.md).

## Prerequisites for EDR profiles

- Windows 10 or later
- For Intune to manage endpoint detection and response settings on a device, you must onboard the device with Defender ATP.

## EDR profiles

**Windows 10 profiles**:

- **Endpoint detection and response** â€“ Manage [settings for Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint detection and response](endpoint-security-edr-profile-settings.md).

  The capabilities of Microsoft Defender ATP endpoint detection and response provide advanced attack detections that are near real-time and actionable.
