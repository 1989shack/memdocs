# Turn off Company Portal for iOS usage data       

This article describes how to prevent Microsoft from collecting data about your Intune Company Portal usage. To do this, you need to adjust your usage data settings in the iOS settings app. 

## About Microsoft data collection   

When usage data for Company Portal is turned on, all in-app performance and usage data is shared annonymously with Microsoft. This type of data helps Microsoft improve the reliability and performance of their products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and they also can't change your usage data preferences. 

# How to turn off data collection    

1. Open the **Settings** app.  
2. Tap **Company Portal**.  
3. Switch the **Usage Data** toggle off.
