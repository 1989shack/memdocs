# Sharing Company Portal usage data with Microsoft     

Company Portal for iOS has a usage data feature that, when enabled, shares your in-app performance and usage data with Microsoft. Your organization can't change your usage data preference, and doesn't have any control over the collection of your data. 

Sharing your Company Portal usage data helps to improve the reliability and performance of other Microsoft products, but it's optional. You can enable or disable this feature from the Settings app.  

## Edit usage data preferences
Change your preference for how Company Portal shares your usage data with Microsoft. 

1. Open the **Settings** app.  
2. Tap **Company Portal**.  
3. Switch the **Usage Data** toggle to the off position (to prevent usage data from being collected), or to the on position (to allow usage data to be collected).
