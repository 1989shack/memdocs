# Troubleshoot Windows 10 device enrollment
This article describes how to resolve access issues for an enrolled Windows 10 device. 

A connection to Wi-Fi is required to access work or school resources. Once you've verified that the issue isn't Wi-Fi related, continue with the steps in this article. 

1. Open the **Settings** app. 
2. Select **Accounts**.
3. This next step varies depending on the version of Windows 10 you're using. Select the option that appears to you in the menu on screen.
    * Select **Access work or school** or
    * Select **Work access**
4. Select the **Connect** plus sign button to add your account. 
3. Sign in with your work or school credentials. 
4. Follow the onscreen prompts to set up your device. 
5. When complete, your account will be added as a connection. You'll have access to any resources your organization makes available.   

## Account already connected
If you see your work or school account listed, your device and account are connected to your organization. Contact your IT support person for further help with access problems.
