# Reset device from Company Portal app for Windows  

Reset a used, lost, or stolen device to its factory settings via the Company Portal app. A reset deletes all apps, settings, and personal data on the device, and restores it back to its original, out-of-box settings. The device will no longer appear in Company Portal. 

 You can reset a Windows 10, Android, iOS, or macOS device from the Company Portal for Windows app. However, the reset option may not be available for all devices if your organization has blocked this setting.   


## Reset device   

1. Open the Company Portal app and sign in with your work or school account.
2. Select **DEVICES**. 
3. Select the device you want to reset.
4. Select the menu button > **Factory Reset**.  
5. Select **RESET** to start the reset.
