# Give Wi-Fi control to Company Portal   

**LN: Can you confirm what the wording/phrases are that's used in the UI? Want to make sure that title SEO is strong.**

During enrollment, Company Portal may prompt you for permission to access your Wi-Fi settings. Company Portal needs this permission to receive Wi-Fi configurations from Intune. If you deny permission, Intune won't be able to deliver the configurations to your device, which could prevent you from connecting to your organization's Wi-Fi network. 

This article describes how to give Company Portal permissions to control Wi-Fi.   

## Required devices      

Company Portal needs permission from devices that are: 

* Running Android, version 10 or later and
* Enrolled in Intune using Android device administrator

Permission isn't required from devices enrolled as Android Enterprise.    

## Edit Wi-Fi control      

Follow these steps to allow Company Portal to control Wi-Fi.   

### Google Pixel devices

1. Open your Settings app.
2. Go to **Apps & notifications** > **Special App access** > **Wi-Fi Control**.  **LN: Just checking b/c I don't have test device to confirm--is capitalization correct for these settings?**
3. Tap **Company Portal**.
4. Turn the toggle on to allow the app to control Wi-Fi.

### Samsung devices

2. Go to **Apps**.
3. Tap **Menu** (appears as 3 dots or lines). 
4. Go to **Special access** > **Wi-Fi Control**.

6. Turn the toggle on to allow the app to control Wi-Fi.  **LN: Does the toggle have a name? Or is it the only toggle that's there?**
