# Send iOS app logs to Microsoft developers 

If Company Portal behaves unexpectedly, you can report the event to Microsoft by uploading your app logs. App logs are saved on your device and contain details about the unexpected events that occur in Company Portal. Microsoft uses these logs to learn from and improve upon future products. 

> [!Tip]
> To make it easier for your support person and app developers to figure out a problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md). 

## Send logs  

1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. (Optional) Try to reproduce the event you experienced. This step ensures that the Company Portal details appear at the top of the report when you send it. 

3. 4. Use one of the following methods to initiate the upload:
    * When you receive a message about a problem, tap **Report**.   
    * Tap **More** > **Get Help**. 
    * Shake your device. Then tap **Send Diagnostic Report**. 

5. Wait while Company Portal uploads the logs. 

6. Save the incident ID for your records. 


## Next steps  
After you upload the logs, you can select **Email details** to report the problem to your IT support person. In the body of the email, explain what you experienced and include your incident ID. 

Still need help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
