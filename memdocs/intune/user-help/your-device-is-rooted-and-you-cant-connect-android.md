# Android device is rooted so you can't connect  

Your device will be blocked from accessing corporate resources if:  

- You install an app on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. If you're prompted to unroot your device immediately after you install an app, try uninstalling that app.  

- Your device manufacturer installed software on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. Contact your IT support person for help. For contact information, go to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).  

_ You rooted the device. Reverse the root (commonly done with PC software or apps) and restore the device back to its previous state. Make sure to back up your device before you begin. 

## Why your access is blocked

A rooted device has had some part of its software changed to enable capabilities that aren't otherwise available.  These changes can make the device prone to unauthorized access and malicious software. So that's why rooted devices are often blocked from accessing company email or files.
