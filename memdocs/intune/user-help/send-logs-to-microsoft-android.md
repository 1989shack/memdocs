# Send Company Portal for Android logs to Microsoft   

Microsoft app developers want to hear from you when unexpected behavior occurs so they can find the root cause and prevent future occurrences. App errors are detailed and saved on your device in a document called a _diagnostic log_. The Company Portal team looks to Company Portal-specific logs to diagnose problems and improve the app.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using a Sovereign cloud environment, the send logs functionality in the Company Portal will not be available to you. You must send logs via email. 

To send logs to Microsoft:  

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**. The **Menu** option may appear as a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3. Tap **Upload Logs Only**.

4. After the upload is complete, you will receive an incident ID. Save the ID for your records.

> [!Tip]
> To make it easier for your support person and app developers to find the cause of a problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md). 


## Next steps  

For additional help, contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
