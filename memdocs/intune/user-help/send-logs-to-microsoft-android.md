# Send Android app logs to Microsoft   

If Company Portal behaves unexpectedly, you can report the event to Microsoft by uploading your app logs. App logs contain details about unexpected events that occur in Company Portal and are saved on your device. Microsoft uses these logs to learn from and improve upon future products. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a Sovereign cloud environment, the send logs feature won't be available to you. Instead, you must send logs via email. 

## Send logs  

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**. The **Menu** option may appear as a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3. Tap **Upload Logs Only**.

4. After the upload is complete, you will receive an incident ID. Save the ID for your records.

> [!Tip]
> To make it easier for your support person and app developers to find the cause of a problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md). 


## Next steps  

For additional help, contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
