## Retrieve recovery key

### Company Portal website 
###  Company Portal app for iOS

You can retrieve your personal recovery key (FileVault key) using the Company Portal app for iOS. Your device that has the personal recovery key must be enrolled with Intune and encrypted with FileVault through Intune. This option is not available for devices that you've personally encrypted. 

Using the Company Portal app, you can open the Safari web view and retrieve your personal recovery key. 

1. Open Company Portal.
2. Click on **Get recovery key**.

The Company Portal website opens in Safari web view and displays the key.
