# Using Microsoft Tunnel for Android

The Microsoft Tunnel creates a secure VPN connection so that you can securely and privately access your corporate network from anywhere. 

## Install Microsoft Tunnel  

The Microsoft Tunnel app is available in Google Play. Before heading there, check your device to see if it's already installed.   

If you canâ€™t find Microsoft Tunnel in the Play store, contact your IT support person for help.  

 

## Connect and disconnect from VPN     

1. Open Microsoft Tunnel. 
2. If prompted to, sign in with your work account. 
3. On the **Connect** screen, flip the switch next to **Status** on or off to connect or disconnect from the VPN. 

Your organization might require you to always connect through a VPN. This is known as an *always-on* connection. If this is the case, you won't have the option to disconnect from the VPN while on their network.  

If the option is stuck in the off position, select **Help** > **Send logs** and report the problem to your IT support person. For more details, see the [Send logs](use-microsoft-tunnel-android.md#send-logs) section in this article. 


## Connection details    

When you connect to the VPN, the following information is visible on the **Connect** screen:  

* **Uptime**: How long the VPN connection has been running. 

* **Data received**: How much data has been received through the VPN connection. 

* **Data sent**: How much data has been sent through the VPN connection.  

Tap **Details** to see the following information:  

* **Address**: The server address for your VPN connection. 

* **Device-wide connection**: When turned on, all network traffic to and from your device goes through the VPN connection.  

* **Apps that use Tunnel**: If apps are listed, then only network traffic to and from the apps listed go through the VPN connection.  

* **Always-on**: When enabled, Microsoft Tunnel will always attempt to send device network traffic or traffic from certain applications through the VPN connection, depending on the configuration.      

## Settings  

From the **Connect** screen, select the **Settings** gear icon to:

* Allow/block Microsoft from collecting usage and performance data. 
* Enable/disable verbose logging.  

## Get help in the app  
Select **Help** from the bottom menu to:  

* Access this article. 
* Send logs to IT support to report a problem.

### Send logs   

Send your app logs to your IT support person to get help with an app or connection problem.  

1. Select **Help** > **Send logs**.
2. Select **Send logs** again. Your logs will be sent to a Microsoft database, from which your organization can access. 
3. Select **EMAIL IT SUPPORT**. 
4. On the Share screen, select your mail app. 
5. Describe the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for. 
6. Send the email.
