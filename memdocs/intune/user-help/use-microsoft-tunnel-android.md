# Using Microsoft Tunnel for Android

The Microsoft Tunnel app helps you securely and privately connect to your corporate network over a VPN. If your organization requires you to use the app, they've already configured a VPN connection for your work account. All you need to do to connect is install the app and sign in.

## Install Microsoft Tunnel  

Tunnel is available in Google Play. Before heading there, check your device to see if it's already installed.   

If you canâ€™t find Tunnel in the Play store, contact your IT support person for help.  

 ## Connect and disconnect from VPN  

1. Open Microsoft Tunnel. 
2. If prompted to, sign in with your work account. 
3. On the **Connect** screen, turn the **Status** switch on or orff to connect or disconnect from the VPN. 

Your organization might require you to stay connected to Tunnel. This is known as an *always-on* connection. If this is the case, the status switch will appear inactive, and you won't be able to disconnect from the VPN as long as you're connected to the internet. 

If the switch is stuck in the off position, select **Help** > **Send logs** and report the problem to your IT support person. For more details, see the [Send logs](use-microsoft-tunnel-android.md#send-logs) section in this article.  


## Connection details    

The following information appears on the **Connect** screen when Tunnel is connected.  

* **Uptime**: How long the VPN connection has been running. 

* **Data received**: How much data has been received through the VPN connection. 

* **Data sent**: How much data has been sent through the VPN connection.  

Tap **Details** to see the following information:  

* **Address**: The server address for your VPN connection. 

* **Device-wide connection**: When turned on, all network traffic to and from your device goes through the VPN connection.  

* **Apps that use Tunnel**: If apps are listed, only network traffic to and from these apps go through the VPN connection.   

* **Always-on**: When enabled, Microsoft Tunnel will continuously try to establish a connection.       

## App settings  

From the **Connect** screen, select the **Settings** gear icon to:

* Allow/block Microsoft from collecting usage and performance data. 
* Enable/disable verbose logging.  

## Get help in the app  
Select **Help** from the menu at the bottom of the screen to:  

* Access this article.  
* Send logs to IT support to report a problem.  

### Send logs   

Send app logs to IT support to get help with an app or connection problem.  

1. Select **Help** > **Send logs**.
2. Select **Send logs** again. Your logs will be sent to a Microsoft database, from which your organization can access. 
3. Select **EMAIL IT SUPPORT**. 
4. On the Share screen, select your mail app. 
5. In the body of the email, describe the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for. 
6. Send the email.
