# Email IT support about Company Portal app problem  

If you run into a problem while using Company Portal on your device, you can use the in-app **Help & support** options to email your support team.

2. Select **Help & support** > **Get help**.

3. On the **Share** screen, select **Mail**. The Mail app will create an email message for you. Type in a description of the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for.

## What is a diagnostic log?

Events and errors that occur in the Company Portal app are saved on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. Logs can reveal:  
* When a problem happened.  
* The steps leading up to the problem.  
* The state of the app when the problem appeared.   

When you report a problem, a diagnostic log ID is assigned to your case. If your support team can't resolve the problem with the details you provide them, they'll contact Microsoft for help. Microsoft will use the diagnostic ID to pull up your logs.   


## Next steps  

* If your company needs additional information about app or device activity, you might need to resend [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md). 

* Still need help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
