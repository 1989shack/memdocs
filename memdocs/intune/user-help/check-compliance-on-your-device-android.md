# Check compliance on your Android device
Initiate a compliance check from Company Portal to regain access to your work or school resources or to update your device status. During a check-in, Company Portal confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's policy requirements.  Some organizations  may limit or restrict access to work or school resources until you check in and confirm that your device is compliant. 

1. Open the Company Portal app for Android on your device.  

2. Tap **Devices** and then select your device.  

3. Under **Device Settings Status**, tap **Check device settings**. Company Portal will check your device to confirm that it's meeting your organization's policy requirements. 

4. After the check, your device settings status will either read, **Compliant** or **Not in Compliance**. If you're required to make any changes, a message will appear at the top of the screen. Tap it for more details. 

For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
