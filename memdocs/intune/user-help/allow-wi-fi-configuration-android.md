During enrollment, Company Portal prompts certain Android devices for permission to receive Wi-Fi network configurations from Intune. If you don't allow it, Intune can't deliver Wi-Fi configurations to your device. So you might be unable to connect to your organization's Wi-Fi network. 

Intune requires permission from devices: 

* Running Android, version 10 or later and
* Enrolled in Intune via Android device administrator

Intune doesn't prompt Android Enterprise devices for this type of permission.  

## Allow permission to configure Wi-Fi  

You can give permission by editing your device settings to allow Company Portal to control Wi-Fi. This section describes how to do this on Google Pixel and Samsung devices. 

### Google Pixel devices

1. Open your Settings app.
2. Go to **Apps & notifications** > **Special App access** > **Wi-Fi Control**.
3. Tap **Company Portal**.
4. Switch the toggle on to allow the app to control Wi-Fi.

### Samsung devices

1. Open your Settings app.
2. Go to **Apps**.
3. Tap Menu 
4. Go to Special access > Wi-Fi Control.
5. Tap Company Portal.
6. Enable the toggle to allow app to control Wi-Fi.
