As of October 2020, you must accept additional permissions  in order to receive Wi-Fi network configurations in Intune.if you have an Android device running Android 10 or later and it's enrolled in Intune using Android device administrator, you'll need to accept additional permissions in order to receive Wi-Fi network configurations in Intune. These permissions aren't required when enrolled as Android Enterprise. If required, you're prompted to accept these permissions when you enroll in Intune. If you choose to not accept these permissions, Intune will be unable to deliver Wi-Fi configurations to your device and you may be unable to connect to your organization's Wi-Fi network. If you get a Company Portal notification telling you to accept additional permissions so your organization can send you Wi-Fi configurations, you can accept these permissions by allowing Company Portal to control Wi-Fi. You can find this setting in your Settings app.
