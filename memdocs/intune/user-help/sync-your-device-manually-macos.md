# Sync your macOS device manually

Initiate a manual sync from Company Portal to fix lags and delays such as slow or stalled app installations. During a sync, Company Portal checks in with your device to make sure it's meeting your organization's requirements. It syncs your device with policies or updates that you may not have yet and can help resolve downloads or other processes that are in progress.  

Company Portal regularly checks in with your device, but you can use the following steps to start a sync anytime from the app. 

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. Select **Devices**.  
3. If you only have one device, you'll go directly to the device details screen and can skip to step 4. If you have multiple devices, you'll see all devices inline at the top of the page. Select the device that you're currently using.

4. Select **More [...]** and then choose **Check Status** to sync your device.

5. Wait while Company Portal confirms your device status. The status will update onscreen to tell you whether or not you meet your organization's security requirements.

## Next steps
Once you've completed these steps, check to see if your initial problem is resolved. If it's not, it may help to restart the stalled installation or task. Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
