# Sync your macOS device manually

Initiate a manual sync from Company Portal to fix lags and delays such as slow or stalled app installations. A manual sync forces Company Portal to check in with your device to make sure it's meeting your organization's requirements, and it can also help resolve downloads or other processes that are in progress.  

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. Select **Devices**.  
3. If you only have one device, you'll go directly to the device details screen and can skip to step 3. If you have multiple devices, you'll see all devices inline at the top of the page. Select the device that you're currently using.

3. Select **More [...]** and then choose **Check Status** to sync your device.

 4. Wait while Company Portal confirms your device status. The status will update onscreen to tell you whether or not you meet your organization's security requirements.

Once you've completed these steps, check to see if your initial problem is resolved. If it's not, it may help to restart the stalled installation or task now that your device is up-to-date with your organization's requirements.
