# Introduction to Android work profile

A work profile is set up on an Android device to separate work apps and data from personal apps and data. The work profile lives on a separate part of the device so that your personal things stay private and unaffected by work. In this article, you'll learn how to:  

* Find your work profile. 
* Tell the difference between work apps and personal apps. 
* Get more apps for work.  
* Pause your work profile.  

Your IT support person can only manage the work-related email, apps, settings, and data on your device. They can’t access the personal email, apps, settings, and data. They also can’t reset or wipe your device. 

To learn how to set up a work profile, see [Create a work profile and enroll your device](enroll-device-android-work-profile.md).  

## Access your work profile  
Once you've set up a work profile, your organization can automatically install work apps on your device. 

The location of the work profile varies by device manufacturer and Android version. This section describes where to find the work profile in the app drawer and on the home screen.  

> [!NOTE] 
> If you're using a custom launcher, work apps can appear in places other than the app drawer or home screen folder.    

### App drawer  
Swipe up on the home screen or select **Apps** to access the app drawer. Work apps appear alongside your personal apps or within a **Work** tab in your app drawer.

To see how it appears on other Android devices, skip to [Examples of work profile](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md#work-profile-in-app-drawer). 


### Folder  
On some devices, work apps are in a work-designated folder on the home screen. This folder is automatically created during setup.

To see how the work profile folder appears on other Android devices, skip to [Examples of work profile](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md#work-profile-folder).  


## Identify work apps 
Work apps are marked with a briefcase badge, while personal apps do not have a briefcase badge. Some screen readers or voice assistants identify work apps by saying "work" before the app name.  

After you've set up the work profile, you may have duplicate apps. For example, you could have two Outlook apps. To check your work email, use the version that's marked with the briefcase.  

For the best experience, always sign in to work apps with your work account, and sign in to personal apps with your personal account. 

|Personal app (no briefcase)|Work app (briefcase)|
|---|---|  
|<img alt="Screenshot of typical Outlook app icon with no work profile briefcase." src="./media/personal-no-briefcase-android.png" width="100>|<img alt="Screenshot of Outlook app icon with work profile briefcase." src="./media/work-briefcase-badge-android.png" width="100">|  

The appearance of the briefcase can vary slightly from device to device. To see how it appears on other Android devices, skip to [Examples of briefcase badge](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md#examples-of-briefcase-badge).  


## Get more work apps  

Open the work version of the Google Play Store to see all of the apps your organization has made available to you.  


<img alt="Screenshot of Google Play Store icon with briefcase badge." src="./media/samsung-galaxy-s20-play-store-android.png" width="200">  

Continue to use the work version of the Play Store to search for and install other apps for work.  If you don’t see an app you need for work, you can request it from your IT support person. 

The appearance of the Google Play Store app varies by device manufacturer and Android version, but the work version is always marked with a briefcase.  

## Pause the work profile  

Pause the work profile to take a break from work apps and notifications. Pausing effectively turns off the work profile by disabling work apps and work notifications. 

The location of the pause setting varies by device manufacturer and Android version (Android 7 and later is required). It's commonly found in quick settings, the Settings app, or the app drawer.  

### Pause in quick settings
Swipe down on your screen to access the quick settings menu. Tap **Work profile** to pause the work profile.

To see how quick settings appear on other Android devices, skip to [Examples of pause setting](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md#quick-settings).  

### Pause in Settings app 
Open the Settings app and go to **Work profile** settings.Switch the **Work profile** toggle off.
