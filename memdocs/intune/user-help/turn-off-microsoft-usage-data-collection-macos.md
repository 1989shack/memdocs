# Turn off Microsoft data collection on macOS device  

This article describes how to prevent Microsoft from collecting data about your Intune Company Portal usage. To turn off data collection in Company Portal:  

1. Open the Company Portal app.  
2. Select the menu button > **Preferences**.
3. Under **Send usage data to Microsoft**, clear the checkbox next to **Allow Microsoft to collect data**.  

## Allowing Microsoft data collection   

When the checkbox for this setting is selected, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically anonymized and shared with Microsoft. This type of data helps us improve the reliability and performance of Microsoft products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and cannot change your preferences.
