# Using Microsoft Tunnel for iOS  

Microsoft Tunnel creates a VPN connection so that you can securely and privately access your corporate network from anywhere. 

## Install Microsoft Tunnel  

Tunnel is available in the App Store. Before heading there, check your device to see if it's already installed.   

If you canâ€™t find Tunnel in the App Store, contact your IT support person for help.  


## Connect and disconnect VPN      

1. Open Microsoft Tunnel. 
2. If prompted to, sign in with your work account. 
3. On the **Connect** screen, turn the **Status** switch on or orff to connect or disconnect from the VPN.  

 
An absent **Status** switch means that Tunnel is configured to connect automatically when certain apps are in use. To turn this functionality off, go to **Details** and turn off **Connect on demand**.    

If the switch is stuck in the off position, select **Help** > **Send logs** and report the problem to your IT support person. For more details, see the [Send logs](use-microsoft-tunnel-ios.md#send-logs) section in this article. 


## Connection details    

The following information appears on the **Connect** screen when Microsoft Tunnel is connected.  

* **Uptime**: How long the VPN connection has been running. 

* **Data received**: How much data has been received through the VPN connection. 

* **Data sent**: How much data has been sent through the VPN connection.  

Tap **Details** to see the following information:  

* **Address**: The server address for your VPN connection. 

* **Script/Address/Port**: These details will help IT support troubleshoot your proxy server connection, should you ever need help. 

* **Device-wide connection**: When turned on, all network traffic to and from your device goes through the VPN connection.  

* **Connect on demand**: When turned on, Microsoft Tunnel automatically connects when certain apps are in use (see **Apps that use Tunnel**).   

* **Apps that use Tunnel**: If apps are listed, only network traffic to and from these apps go through the VPN connection.  

## App settings  

To configure how your app collects and logs data, open the **Settings** app on your device. Select **Microsoft Tunnel** to:  

* Allow/block Microsoft from collecting usage and performance data. 
* Enable/disable verbose logging. 


## Get help in the app  
Select **Help** from the bottom menu to:  

* Access documentation (directs you to this article). 
* Send logs to IT support to report a problem.  

### Send logs   

Send your app logs to your IT support person to get help with an app or connection problem.  

1. Select **Help** > **Send logs**.
2. Select **Send logs** again. Your logs will be sent to a Microsoft database, from which your organization can access. 
3. Select **Email administrator**. 
5. In the email, describe the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for. 
6. Send the email.
