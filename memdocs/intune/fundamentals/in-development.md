## App management

### Export underlying discovered apps list data<!-- 9370255  -->

In addition to exporting the summarized discovered apps list data, you'll also be able export the more extensive underlying data. The current summarized export experience provides summarized aggregate data, however the new experience will also provide the raw data. The raw data export will give you the entire dataset, which is used to create the summarized aggregate report. The raw data will be a list of every device and each app discovered for that device. This functionality is being added to the Intune console to replace the Intune Data Warehouse Application Inventories dataset, which will be removed in an upcoming Intune service release. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **Monitor** > **Discovered apps** > **Export** to display the export options. For related information, see [Intune discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md) and [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### Maximum OS version setting for app conditional launch<!-- 9493137  -->

Using iOS app protection policies in Microsoft Intune app protection policies, you'll be able to add a new conditional launch setting to ensure end users are not using a pre-release or beta OS build to access work or school account data. This setting ensures that you can vet all OS releases before end users are actively using new OS functionality. In [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you'll be able to find this setting by selecting **Apps** > **App protection policies**. For related information, see [How to create and assign app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policies.md).

### Unified delivery of Azure AD Enterprise and Office Online applications in the Android Company Portal<!-- 1817862  -->

Last year, we announced [Unified delivery of Azure AD Enterprise and Office Online applications in the Company Portal website](../fundamentals/whats-new-archive.md#unified-delivery-of-azure-ad-enterprise-and-office-online-applications-in-the-windows-company-portal). This feature will be supported for users who get their apps directly from the Android Company Portal. On the **Customization** pane of Intune, select to **Hide** or **Show** both **Azure AD Enterprise applications** and **Office Online applications** in the Company Portal. Each end user will see their entire application catalog from the chosen Microsoft service. By default, each additional app source will be set to **Hide**. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Customization** to find this configuration setting. For related information, see [How to customize the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration

### Use a Settings Catalog policy in a policy set for Windows and macOS devices<!-- 8851701  -->

In Intune, you can create a policy using [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md), which lists all the settings you can configure. Now, you can use the Settings Catalog policy within a policy set.

For more information, see [Use policy sets to group collections of management objects](policy-sets.md).

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

### Settings catalog policies for policy sets<!-- 8683467  -->

In addition to profiles based on templates, you'll be able to add a profiles based on the **Settings catalog** to your policy sets. The **Settings catalog** is a list of all the settings you can configure. To create a policy set in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Policy sets** > **Policy sets** > **Create**. For more information, see [Use policy sets to group collections of management objects](../fundamentals/policy-sets.md) and [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows and macOS devices - preview](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

### Use filters on DFCI configuration profiles on Windows 10 RS5 (1809) and newer devices<!-- 8817773  -->

In Endpoint Manager, you can create filters to target devices based on different properties. When you create a Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profile, you'll be able to use filters when assigning the profile.

- For more information about filters, see [Use filters (preview) when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).
- For more information about the DFCI profile, see [Use Device Firmware Configuration Interface profiles on Windows devices](../configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10 RS5 (1809) and newer on supported UEFI

### Use filters to assign Endpoint analytics proactive remediations scripts and Endpoint Security policies in Endpoint Manager admin center - public preview<!-- 7566953 7591178  -->

In the Endpoint Manager admin center, you can create filters, and then use these filters when assigning apps and policies. You'll be able to use filters to assign the following policies:

- [Endpoint analytics proactive remediations Windows PowerShell scripts](../../analytics/proactive-remediations.md) (**Reports** > **Endpoint analytics** > **Proactive remediations**)
- [Endpoint Security policies](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md), including Account protection, Antivirus, Attack surface reduction, and more.

For more information on filters, see [Use filters (preview) when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

### Manage Windows 10 security updates for Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session VMs<!-- 8682461  -->

You’ll soon be able to use the Settings Catalog to deploy Windows 10 quality updates to Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session virtual machines. (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 or later** > **Settings catalog**)

To find the relevant settings, in the Settings Catalog, [use the Settings filter to focus on the OS type of Enterprise multi-session](../fundamentals/azure-virtual-desktop-multi-session.md#to-configure-policies). Then select the Windows Update for Business category where you’ll now see only those settings that are supported for multi-session VMs.

The Windows Update settings for quality updates that you’ll soon be able to use with multi-session VMs include:

- Active Hours End
- Active Hours Max Range
- Active Hours Start
- Block "Pause Updates" ability
- Configure Deadline Grace Period
- Defer Quality Updates Period (Days)
- Pause Quality Updates Start Time
- Quality Update Deadline Period (Days)

### Tenant attach: Offboarding <!--9412904 -->

While we know customers get enormous value by enabling tenant attach with Configuration Manager, there are rare cases where you might need to offboard a hierarchy. For example, you may need to offboard from the cloud following a disaster recovery scenario where the on-premises environment was removed. You'll soon be able to offboard a Configuration Manager environment from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

### Intune moving to support iOS/iPadOS 13 and higher later this year<!-- 9964998 idrady-->

Later this year, Apple is expected to release iOS 15. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies will require [iOS/iPadOS 13 and higher](supported-devices-browsers.md) shortly after the release of iOS 15.

### Intune moving to support  macOS 10.15 and later with the release of macOS 12<!-- 10154527 -->

Apple is expected to release macOS 12 (Monterey) in the fall of 2021. Microsoft Intune, including the Company Portal and Intune MDM agent, will require macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later shortly after the release of macOS 12.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Intune apps

### Intune management agent for macOS devices will be a universal app<!-- 9294405  -->

When you deploy shell scripts or custom attributes for macOS devices from Microsoft Endpoint Manager, it will deploy the new universal version of the Intune management agent app that runs natively on Apple Silicon Mac machines. The same deployment will install the x64 version of the app on Intel Mac machines. For related information, see [Microsoft Intune management agent for macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md#microsoft-intune-management-agent-for-macos).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Account protection policy changes in Endpoint security<!--  7492116   -->

We’re reworking the endpoint security Account protection policy to use the new APIs for Windows Hello for Business. The new APIs will result in a more consistent experience. The new API is *./Device/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*, which includes more options that can help reduce conflicts.   This API replaces the use of  *./User/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*.  (**Endpoint security** > **Account protection**)

After the change, only new policies you then create will use the new API. Your existing policies won’t be affected by this change and will continue to use the older API.

### Filter evaluation report will be improved<!-- 9974516   -->

The **Filter evaluation** page, which shows every app or policy that was filtered, will be improved to include results for available app assignments. In [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **All devices** > *select a device* > **Filter evaluation**.

### Device filter evaluation reports now include filter results for assigned apps<!-- 9974516   -->

If you’re using filters for assigning apps as available, you can now use the filter evaluation report on a device to determine if an app has been made available for install. You can see this report per device, under **Devices > All Devices > select a device > Filter evaluation (preview)**.

- For more information on filters, see [Use filters (preview) when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Endpoint Manager](filters.md).
- For more information on filter reports, see [Filter reports and troubleshooting in Microsoft Endpoint Manager](filters-reports-troubleshoot.md).

Applies to:

- Android device administrator
- Android Enterprise
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

### Update when exporting Intune reports using the Graph API<!-- 8764428  -->

When you use the Graph API to export Intune reports without selecting any columns for the devices report, you'll receive the default column set. To reduce confusion, we'll be removing columns from the default column set starting January 2021. The columns being removed are `PhoneNumberE164Format`, `_ComputedComplianceState`, `_OS`, and `OSDescription`. These columns will still be available for selection if you need them, but only explicitly, and not by default. If you have built automation around the default columns of the device export, and that automation uses any of these columns, you need to refactor your processes to explicitly select these and any other relevant columns. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### Intune Data Warehouse updates<!-- 9370034 -->

The  `applicationInventory`  entity will be removed from the Intune Data Warehouse in an upcoming Intune service release. We're introducing a more complete and accurate dataset that will be available in the UI and via our export API. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).
