## App management

### Update to device icons in Company Portal and Intune apps on Android<!-- 6057023  -->
We're updating the device icons in the Company Portal and Intune apps on Android devices to create a more modern look and feel and to align with the Microsoft Fluent Design System. For related information, see [Update to icons in Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS and macOS](../fundamentals/whats-new-app-ui.md#update-to-icons-in-company-portal-app-for-iosipados-and-macos-). 

### iOS Company Portal will support Apple's Automated Device Enrollment without user affinity<!-- 7282707  --> 
iOS Company Portal will be supported on devices enrolled using Apple's Automated Device Enrollment without requiring an assigned user. An end user can sign in to the iOS Company Portal to establish themselves as the primary user on an iOS/iPadOS device enrolled without device affinity. For more information about Automated Device Enrollment, see [Automatically enroll iOS/iPadOS devices with Apple's Automated Device Enrollment](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md).

### The Company Portal adds Configuration Manager application support<!-- 4297660 -->
The Company Portal now supports Configuration Manager applications. This feature allows end users to see both Configuration Manager and Intune deployed applications in the Company Portal for co-managed customers. This support will help administrators consolidate their different end-user portal experiences. For more information, see [Use the Company Portal app on co-managed devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2006#bkmk_portal).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration

### Set device compliance state from third-party MDM partners<!-- 6361689   -->
Microsoft 365 customers who own third-party MDM solutions will be able to enforce Conditional Access policies for Microsoft 365 apps on iOS and Android via integration with Microsoft Intune Device Compliance service. Third-party MDM vendor will leverage the Intune Device Compliance service to send device compliance data to Intune. Intune will then evaluate to determine if the device is trusted and set the conditional access attributes in Azure AD.  Customers will be required to set Azure AD Conditional Access policies from within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center or the Azure AD portal.

## Device management

### PowerShell scripts support for BYOD devices<!-- 1862833  -->
PowerShell scripts will support Azure AD registered devices in Intune. For more information about PowerShell, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md). This functionality does not support devices running Windows 10 Home edition.

### Log Analytics will include device details log<!--6014987  -->
Intune device detail logs will be available in **Reports** > **Log analytics**. You can correlate device details to build custom queries and Azure workbooks.

### Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center<!--7220536, CM7141381 -->
When Configuration Manager synchronizes a device to Microsoft Endpoint Manager through tenant attach, you'll be able to see a timeline of events. This timeline shows past activity on the device that can help you troubleshoot problems. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_timeline).  

### Tenant attach: Install an application from the admin center<!-- 7220536, CM6024389 -->
You'll be able to initiate an application install in real time for a tenant attached device from the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_apps).

### Tenant attach: CMPivot from the admin center<!--7220536, CM6024392 -->
You'll be able to bring the power of [CMPivot](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-overview-attached.md) to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to be able to initiate real-time queries from the cloud against an individual ConfigMgr managed device and return the results back to the admin center. This gives all the traditional benefits of CMPivot, which allows IT Admins and other designated personas the ability to quickly assess the state of devices in their environment and take action. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_cmpivot). 

### Tenant attach: Run Scripts from the admin center<!--7220536, CM6234688 -->
You'll be able to bring the power of the Configuration Manager on-premises [Run Scripts](../../configmgr/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md) feature to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to run PowerShell scripts from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device. This gives all the traditional benefits of PowerShell scripts that have already been defined and approved by the Configuration Manager admin to this new environment. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_scripts). 

### New merge logic for Windows 10 devices<!--179048-->
Today, if a customer reimages a device and then re-enrolls it, multiple records for the device will appear in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console. New merge logic is in development to merge such duplicate records for Windows 10 devices.

### Deploy Software Updates to macOS devices <!-- 3194876 -->
You'll be able to deploy Software Updates to groups of macOS devices. This feature includes critical, firmware, configuration file, and other updates. You'll be able to send updates on the next device check-in or select a weekly schedule to deploy updates in or out of time windows that you set. This helps when you want to update devices outside standard work hours or when your help desk is fully staffed. You'll also get a detailed report of all macOS devices with updates deployed. You can drill into the report on a per-device basis to see the statuses of particular updates.

## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Power BI compliance report template V2.0<!-- 636958  -->
Admins will be able to update the Power BI compliance report template version from V1.0 to V2.0. V2.0 will include an improved design, as well as changes to the calculations and data that are being surfaced as part of the template. For related information, see [Connect to the Data Warehouse with Power BI](../developer/reports-proc-get-a-link-powerbi.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Role-based access control

### Scope tag support for customization policies<!--6182440 -->
You'll be able to assign scope tags to Customization policies. To do so, go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration**> **Customization** where you will see **Scope tags** configuration options.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Security

### App protection policy support for Symantec Endpoint Security and Check Point Sandblast<!--  4452423, 4731168 -->

In October of 2019, Intune app protection policy added the capability to use data from some of our Microsoft Threat Defense partners (MTD partners). We are adding support for the following partners, to use an app protection policy to block, or selectively wipe the user's corporate data based on the health of a device:

- **Check Point Sandblast** on Android, iOS and iPadOS
- **Symantec Endpoint Security** on Android, iOS and iPadOS

For information about using app protection policy with MTD partners, see [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).
