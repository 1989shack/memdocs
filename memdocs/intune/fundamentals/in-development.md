# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this page lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information on this page: 

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's a preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Check back for additional updates.
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

> [!NOTE]
> This page reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This page doesn't describe all features in development.

## App management

### The Company Portal adds Configuration Manager application support<!-- 4297660 -->
The Company Portal now supports Configuration Manager applications. This feature allows end users to see both Configuration Manager and Intune deployed applications in the Company Portal for co-managed customers. This support will help administrators consolidate their different end user portal experiences. For more information, see [Use the Company Portal app on co-managed devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2006#bkmk_portal).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration

### Set device compliance state from third-party MDM partners<!-- 6361689   -->
Microsoft 365 customers who own third-party MDM solutions will be able to enforce Conditional Access policies for Microsoft 365 apps on iOS and Android via integration with Microsoft Intune Device Compliance service. Third-party MDM vendor will leverage the Intune Device Compliance service to send device compliance data to Intune. Intune will then evaluate to determine if the device is trusted and set the conditional access attributes in Azure AD.  Customers will be required to set Azure AD Conditional Access policies from within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center or the Azure AD portal.  


### New VPN settings for Windows 10 and newer devices<!-- 6602122  -->
When you create a VPN profile using the IKEv2 connection type, there are new settings you can configure (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **VPN** for profile > **Base VPN**):

- **Device Tunnel**: Allows devices to automatically connect to VPN without requiring any user interaction, including user log on. This feature requires you to enable **Always On**, and use **Machine certificates** as the authentication method.
- Cryptography suite settings: Configure the algorithms used to secure IKE and child security associations, which allow you to match client and server settings.

To see the settings you can configure, go to [Windows device settings to add VPN connections using Intune](../configuration/vpn-settings-windows-10.md).

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

## Device management

### PowerShell scripts support for BYOD devices<!-- 1862833  -->
PowerShell scripts will support Azure AD registered devices in Intune. For more information about PowerShell, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md). This functionality does not support devices running Windows 10 Home edition.

### Log Analytics will include device details log<!--6014987  -->
Intune device detail logs will be available in **Reports** > **Log analytics**. You can correlate device details to build custom queries and Azure workbooks.

### Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center<!--7220536, CM7141381 -->
When Configuration Manager synchronizes a device to Microsoft Endpoint Manager through tenant attach, you'll be able to see a timeline of events. This timeline shows past activity on the device that can help you troubleshoot problems. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_timeline).  

### Tenant attach: Install an application from the admin center<!-- 7220536, CM6024389 -->
You'll be able to initiate an application install in real time for a tenant attached device from the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_apps).

### Tenant attach: CMPivot from the admin center<!--7220536, CM6024392 -->
You'll be able to bring the power of [CMPivot](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-overview-attached.md) to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to be able to initiate real-time queries from the cloud against an individual ConfigMgr managed device and return the results back to the admin center. This gives all the traditional benefits of CMPivot, which allows IT Admins and other designated personas the ability to quickly assess the state of devices in their environment and take action. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_cmpivot). 

### Tenant attach: Run Scripts from the admin center<!--7220536, CM6234688 -->
You'll be able to bring the power of the Configuration Manager on-premises [Run Scripts](../../configmgr/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md) feature to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to run PowerShell scripts from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device. This gives all the traditional benefits of PowerShell scripts that have already been defined and approved by the Configuration Manager admin to this new environment. For more information, see [Configuration Manager technical preview 2005](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_scripts). 

### New merge logic for Windows 10 devices<!--179048-->
Today, if a customer reimages a device and then re-enrolls it, multiple records for the device will appear in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console. New merge logic is in development to merge such duplicate records for Windows 10 devices.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Power BI compliance report template V2.0<!-- 636958  -->
Admins will be able to update the Power BI compliance report template version from V1.0 to V2.0. V2.0 will include an improved design, as well as changes to the calculations and data that is being surfaced as part of the template. For related information, see [Connect to the Data Warehouse with Power BI](../developer/reports-proc-get-a-link-powerbi.md).
