## App management

### Export underlying discovered apps list data<!-- 9370255  -->

In addition to exporting the summarized discovered apps list data, you will also be able export the more extensive underlying data. The current summarized export experience provides summarized aggregate data, however the additional new experience will also provide the raw data. The raw data export will give you the entire dataset, which is used to create the summarized aggregate report. The raw data will be a list of every device and each app discovered for that device. This functionality is being added to the Intune console to replace the Intune Data Warehouse Application Inventories dataset, which will be removed in the 2108 release. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **Monitor** > **Discovered apps** > **Export** to display the export options. For related information, see [Intune discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md) and [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### Maximum OS version setting for app conditional launch<!-- 9493137  -->

Using iOS app protection policies in Microsoft Intune app protection policies, you will be able to add a new conditional launch setting to ensure end users are not using a pre-release or beta OS build to access work or school account data. This setting ensures that you can vet all OS releases before end users are actively using new OS functionality. In [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you will be able to find this setting by selecting **Apps** > **App protection policies**. For related information, see [How to create and assign app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policies.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration

### See policy compliance for a device in tenant attach in Endpoint Manager<!-- 9264837 -->

To manage your devices from the cloud, you can attach your Configuration Manager infrastructure to Endpoint Manager. When deploying Endpoint Security policy to tenant attached devices, you'll be able to see the overall compliance status for the policy. With device level reporting, you'll be able to see the compliance state for a policy at the device level in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

For more information on what you can do in Endpoint Manager in a tenant attach setup, see [Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).

### Machine Risk Score compliance policy for Mac devices<!--  7373781   -->

We’re adding support to device compliance policy to use the risk assessment score from your defense threat service for macOS devices that run 10.14 or later. (**Devices** > **Compliance policies** > **Policies** > **Create Policy** > for *Platform* select **macOS**).

This implementation will be similar to the support Intune has for [Windows devices](../protect/compliance-policy-create-windows.md#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-rules).

### Use a Settings Catalog policy in a policy set for Windows and macOS devices<!-- 8851701  -->

In Intune, you can create a policy using [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md), which lists all the settings you can configure. Now, you can use the Settings Catalog policy within a policy set.

For more information, see [Use policy sets to group collections of management objects](policy-sets.md).

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

### Per setting status report in Settings Catalog<!-- 9061277  -->

When using **Settings Catalog**, you can see how many devices are in each state, including success, conflict, and error. This report will include a **Per setting status** that will:

- Show the total number of devices impacted by a specific setting.
- Have controls to search, sort, filter, export, and go to the next/previous pages.

For more information on the Settings Catalog, see [Use the Settings Catalog to configure settings on Windows and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

### New settings for iOS/iPadOS 14.5 devices and newer <!-- 9428309 -->

When creating a device restrictions policy for iOS/iPadOS devices, there are new settings available (Devices > Configuration profiles > Create profile > iOS/iPadOS > Device restrictions > Connected devices):

- **Block Apple Watch auto unlock**: Set to **Yes** to block users from unlocking their device with Apple Watch.
- **Allow users to boot devices into recovery mode with unpaired devices**: Set to **Yes** to allow users to boot their device into recovery with an unpaired device.
- **Block Siri for dictation**: Set to **Yes** to disable connections to Siri servers so that users can't use Siri to dictate text.
- **Require devices to use Wi-Fi networks set up via configuration profiles**: Set to **Yes**to require devices to only use Wi-Fi networks set up through configuration profiles.

To see the settings you can currently configure, go to [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS 14.5 and newer

### Settings catalog policies for policy sets<!-- 8683467  -->

In addition to profiles based on templates, you will be able to add a profiles based on the **Settings catalog** to your policy sets. The **Settings catalog** is a list of all the settings you can configure. To create a policy set in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Policy sets** > **Policy sets** > **Create**. For more information, see [Use policy sets to group collections of management objects](../fundamentals/policy-sets.md) and [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows and macOS devices - preview](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

## Device management

### Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session support (public preview)<!--8666391 -->

This support will give users a familiar Windows 10 experience while you get the cost advantages of multi-session and existing per-user Microsoft 365 licensing. This upcoming support will let you:

- Host multiple concurrent user sessions using the  new Remote Desktop Session Host exclusive to Windows Virtual Desktop on Azure.
- Manage multi-session remote desktops with device-based configurations like a shared, user-less Windows 10 Enterprise client.
- Automatically enroll Hybrid Azure AD joined virtual machines in Intune and target them with OS scope policies and apps.

### Use Intune policy to expedite installation of Windows 10 quality updates<!-- 5584682  -->

As part of a public preview, you’ll soon be able to use Intune’s *Windows 10 quality updates* policy to expedite installation of the most recent Windows 10 updates to devices you manage with Intune. (**Devices** > **Windows 10 quality updates (preview)** > **Create profile**).

When you expedite an update, devices can start the download and install of the update as soon as possible, without having to wait for the device to check in for updates. Other than expediting the install of the update, use of this policy leaves your existing update deployment policies and processes untouched.

### Support ending for Restart remote action on Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile<!--9584646 -->

Support will end for the **Restart** remote action on corporate-owned devices with a work profile. The **Restart** button will be removed from the **Device** page for corporate-owned devices with a work profile. If you try to restart devices using bulk device actions, the corporate-owned work profile devices won't restart and those device actions will report as **Not supported**. Other device types that are included in the bulk device action will restart as normal for that action.

### Tenant attach: Offboarding <!--9412904 -->

While we know customers get enormous value by enabling tenant attach with Configuration Manager, there are rare cases where you might need to offboard a hierarchy. For example, you may need to offboard from the cloud following a disaster recovery scenario where the on-premises environment was removed. You'll soon be able to offboard a Configuration Manager environment from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Intune apps

### End users can restart an app install from the Company Portal<!-- 652935  -->

Using the Company Portal, end users will be able to restart an app installation if the progress seems to have stalled or is frozen. This functionality is allowed if the app installation progress has not changed in two hours.

### Intune management agent for macOS devices will be a universal app<!-- 9294405  -->

When you deploy shell scripts or custom attributes for macOS devices from Microsoft Endpoint Manager, it will deploy the new universal version of the Intune management agent app that runs natively on Apple Silicon Mac machines. The same deployment will install the x64 version of the app on Intel Mac machines. For related information, see [Microsoft Intune management agent for macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md#microsoft-intune-management-agent-for-macos).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Account protection policy changes in Endpoint security<!--  7492116   -->

We’re reworking the endpoint security Account protection policy to use the new APIs for Windows Hello for Business. The new APIs will result in a more consistent experience. The new API is *./Device/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*, which includes more options that can help reduce conflicts.   This API replaces the use of  *./User/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*.  (**Endpoint security** > **Account protection**)

After the change, only new policies you then create will use the new API. Your existing policies won’t be affected by this change and will continue to use the older API.

### Organizational report focused on device configuration<!-- 8455708  -->

We'll be releasing a new **Device configuration** organizational report. This report will replace the existing **Assignment status** report found in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) under **Devices** > **Monitor**. The **Device configuration** report will allow you to generate a list of profiles in the tenant that have devices in a state of success, error, conflict, or not applicable. You can use filters for the profile type, OS, and state. The returned results will provide search, sort, filter, pagination, and export capabilities. In addition to device configuration details, this report will provide resource access details, and new Settings Catalog profile details. For related information, see [Intune Reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

### Export Intune reports using Graph API v1.0 or beta<!-- 8090911  -->

Intune reporting export API will be available in Graph v1.0, and will continue to be available in Graph beta. For related information, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md) and [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### Update when exporting Intune reports using the Graph API<!-- 8764428  -->

When you use the Graph API to export Intune reports without selecting any columns for the devices report, you'll receive the default column set. To reduce confusion, we'll be removing columns from the default column set starting January 2021. The columns being removed are `PhoneNumberE164Format`, `_ComputedComplianceState`, `_OS`, and `OSDescription`. These columns will still be available for selection if you need them, but only explicitly, and not by default. If you have built automation around the default columns of the device export, and that automation uses any of these columns, you need to refactor your processes to explicitly select these and any other relevant columns. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### Intune Data Warehouse updates<!-- 9370034 -->

The  `applicationInventory`  entity will be removed from the Intune Data Warehouse with the 2108 service update of Intune. We're introducing a more complete and accurate dataset that will be available in the UI and via our export API. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

### New property value will be supported in the managementAgentType enum<!-- 9749555  -->

The `IntuneAosp` property value will be supported in the `managementAgentType` enum. The `ManagementAgentTypeID` value for this property will be `2048`.  It represents the device type that is managed by Intune's mobile device management (MDM) for AOSP (Android Open Source Project) devices. For related information, see [managementAgentType](../developer/reports-ref-devices.md#managementagenttypes) in the beta section of the Intune Data Warehouse API.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Security

### New options for Tunnel Gateway server upgrades<!-- 8664465    -->

You'll soon be able to configure some aspects of Microsoft Tunnel Gateway server upgrades. (**Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway (preview)**)

Options include:

- Restrict the start of server upgrades to a specific time window.
- Configure servers at a site to upgrade manually, or require the admin to approve an upgrade before it can start.

We're also adding a new health check setting that helps you identify when a server is running the latest version of Tunnel Gateway.
