# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Password complexity for Android devices<!-- 9321870 -->
The **Require device lock** setting in Intune will be extended to include values (**Low Complexity**, **Medium Complexity**, and **High Complexity**). If the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement, you'll be able to **warn**, **wipe data**, or **block** the end user from accessing a managed account in a managed app. 

This feature targets devices that operate on Android 11+. For devices that operate on Android 10 and earlier, setting a complexity value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** will default to the expected behavior for **Low Complexity**. For related information, see [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](..\apps\app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

With this capability, when configuring the policy youâ€™ll be able to select users from the Azure AD group picker, or manually add users by their SID.


<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Scripting

### Intune Data Warehouse updates<!-- 9370034 -->

The `applicationInventory` entity will be removed from the Intune Data Warehouse in an upcoming Intune service release. We're introducing a more complete and accurate dataset that will be available in the UI and via our export API. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).
