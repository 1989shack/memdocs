# What is Microsoft Surface management portal?  

Microsoft Surface management portal is a centralized place in Microsoft Endpoint Manager where you can self-serve, manage, and monitor your organization's Intune-managed Surface devices at scale. Surface management portal offers insights about the enrolled Surface devices in your organization, such as warranty eligibility and open support requests. 

You can use it to:

* See all enrolled Surface devices in your organization.  
* Drill down into reports, support requests, and individual devices.  
* View warranty data and expiration dates.   
* Track warranty and support requests.  
* Access Microsoft Surface news and resources.  

To access the Surface management portal, sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **All services** > **Surface management portal**. 

This article describes the main features of the Surface management portal.

Warranty information is available in the Surface management portal for devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune. Select **Warranty and coverage** to manage all of the warranty data that's associated with your Surface devices.
