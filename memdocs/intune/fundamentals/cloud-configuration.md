# Windows 10 in cloud configuration

Windows 10 in cloud configuration is a Microsoft-recommended device configuration. You can turn any Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise, and Education device into a cloud-optimized endpoint. Itâ€™s great for frontline workers, remote workers, and other users with focused workflow needs, like productivity and browsing. You can deploy a cloud configuration using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to configure new devices, or to repurpose existing hardware to extend its lifetime.

Cloud config provides an easy-to-use, and familiar Windows experience for users. And, makes management and troubleshooting easier by enabling admins to apply a uniform device configuration across devices.
