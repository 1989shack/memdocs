# Co-management quickstarts

Co-management offers immediate value as soon as you enable it. You can gain this value using many of the tools you already own and use today.

Co-management can help you right now with the following scenarios:

- **Modern provisioning**: Use Windows Autopilot to provision new devices and bring under management with Configuration Manager  

- **Modern management transformation**: Transition devices into a modern management state  

- **Conditional access with device compliance**: Enhance your use of conditional access using Microsoft Intune compliance controls  

- **User device modernization**: Consolidate device management by moving away from Active Directory group policy to Intune with cloud-attached Configuration Manager
