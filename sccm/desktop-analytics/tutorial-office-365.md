### Update Configuration Manager

Install Configuration Manager hotfix KB4482615 to support integration with Desktop Analytics. 

1. Update the site  

    1. If you opted into the 1810 update by running a PowerShell script in late November or early December 2018, then first update to the generally available version.  

        1. First disable [automatic client upgrade](/sccm/core/clients/manage/upgrade/upgrade-clients-for-windows-computers#to-configure-automatic-client-upgrades). This action makes sure that clients don't upgrade twice.  

        2. Install the prerequisite 1810 GA rollup update **KB4479288**. (Package ID 930FA45E-530F-4B08-B1BF-DE3F5267B03C) This update is generally available in early January to all customers on the "fast ring" version of 1810.  

        > [!Note]  
        > If you updated to version 1810 when it was generally available after 19 December 2018, you don't need update KB4479288.  

    2. Download hotfix **KB4482615** from the [Microsoft Download Center](). (Package ID 86450B7D-3574-4CF7-8B11-486A2C1F62A6) <!--link will be available once the package is published-->  

    2. [Use the update registration tool to import hotfixes](/sccm/core/servers/manage/use-the-update-registration-tool-to-import-hotfixes)  

2. Update clients. To simplify this process, consider using automatic client upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade clients](/sccm/core/clients/manage/upgrade/upgrade-clients#automatic-client-upgrade).  


### Create an app in Azure AD for Configuration Manager  

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), go to **Azure Active Directory**, and select **App registrations**. Then select **New application registration**.  

2. In the **Create** panel, configure the following settings:  

    - **Name**: a unique name that identifies the app, for example: `Desktop-Analytics-Connection`  

    - **Application type**: **Web app / API**  

    - **Sign-on URL**: this value isn't used by Configuration Manager, but required by Azure AD. Enter a unique and valid URL, for example: `https://configmgrapp`  
  
    Select **Create**.  

3. Select the app, and note the **Application ID**. This value is a GUID that's used to configure the Configuration Manager connection.  

4. Select **Settings** on the app, and then select **Keys**. In the **Passwords** section, enter a **Key description**, specify an expiration **Duration**, and then select **Save**. Copy the **Value** of the key, which is used to configure the Configuration Manager connection. 

    > [!Important]  
    > This is the only opportunity to copy the key value. If you don't copy it now, you need to create another key.  
    > 
    > Save the key value in a secure location.  

5. On the app **Settings** panel, select **Required permissions**.  

    1. On the **Required permissions** panel, select **Add**.  

    2. In the **Add API access** panel, **Select an API**.  

    3. Search for the **Configuration Manager Microservice** API. Select it, and then choose **Select**.  

    4. On the **Enable Access** panel, select both of the application permissions: **Write CM Collection Data** and **Read CM Collection Data**. Then choose **Select**.  

    5. On the **Add API access** panel, select **Done**.  

6. On the **Required permissions** page, select **Grant permissions**. Select **Yes**.  

7. Copy the Azure AD tenant ID. This value is a GUID that's used to configure the Configuration Manager connection. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the main menu, and then select **Properties**. Copy the **Directory ID** value.  



## Connect Configuration Manager

Use this procedure to connect Configuration Manager to Desktop Analytics, and configure device settings. This procedure is a one-time process to attach your hierarchy to the cloud service.  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Azure Services** node. Select **Configure Azure Services** in the ribbon.  

2. On the **Azure Services** page of the Azure Services Wizard, configure the following settings:  

    - Specify a **Name** for the object in Configuration Manager  

    - Specify an optional **Description** to help you identify the service  

    - Select **Desktop Analytics** from the list of available services  
  
   Select **Next**.  

3. On the **App** page, select the appropriate **Azure environment**. Then select **Import** for the web app. Configure the following settings in the **Import Apps** window:  

    - **Azure AD Tenant Name**: This name is how it's named in Configuration Manager  

    - **Azure AD Tenant ID**: The **Directory ID** you copied from Azure AD   

    - **Client ID**: The **Application ID** you copied from the Azure AD app   

    - **Secret Key**: The key **Value** you copied from the Azure AD app   

    - **Secret Key Expiry**: The same expiration date of the key   

    - **App ID URI**: This setting should automatically populate with the following value: `https://cmmicrosvc.manage.microsoft.com/`  
  
   Select **Verify**, and then select **OK** to close the Import Apps window. Select **Next** on the App page of the Azure Services Wizard.  

4. On the **Diagnostic Data** page, configure the following settings:  

    - **Commercial ID**: this value should automatically populate with your organization's ID  

    - **Windows 10 diagnostic data level**: select at least **Enhanced**  

    - **Allow Device Name in diagnostic data**: select **Enable**  
  
   Select **Next**. The **Available functionality** page shows the Desktop Analytics functionality that's available with the diagnostic data settings from the previous page. Select **Next**.  

5. On the **Collections** page, configure the following settings:  

    - **Display name**: The Desktop Analytics portal displays this Configuration Manager connection using this name. Use it to differentiate between different hierarchies. For example, *test lab* or *production*.  

    - **Target collection**: This collection includes all devices that Configuration Manager configures with your commercial ID and diagnostic data settings. It's the full set of devices that Configuration Manager connects to the Desktop Analytics service.  

    - **Devices in the target collection use a user-authenticated proxy for outbound communication**: By default, this value is **No**. If needed in your environment, set to **Yes**.   

    - **Select specific collections to synchronize with Desktop Analytics**: Select **Add** to include additional collections. These collections are available in the Desktop Analytics portal for grouping with deployment plans. Make sure to include pilot and pilot exclusion collections.  

        These collections continue to sync as their membership changes. For example, your deployment plan uses a collection with a Windows 7 membership rule. As those devices upgrade to Windows 10, and Configuration Manager evaluates the collection membership, those devices drop out of the collection and deployment plan.  

<!--         > [!Warning]  
        > For the Desktop Analytics private preview, the total membership of all collections shouldn't be more than 10,000 devices. These collections include the Target Collection and each additional collection.  
 -->
6. Complete the wizard.  

Configuration Manager creates a settings policy to configure devices in the Target Collection. This policy includes the diagnostic data settings to enable devices to send data to Microsoft. By default, clients update policy every hour. After receiving the new settings, it can be several hours more before the data is available in Desktop Analytics.

Monitor the configuration of your devices for Desktop Analytics. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand the **Microsoft 365 Servicing** node, and select the **Connection Health** dashboard.  

Configuration Manager synchronizes any Desktop Analytics deployment plans within 15 minutes of creating the connection. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand the **Microsoft 365 Servicing** node, and select the **Deployment Plans** node. 



## Create a Desktop Analytics deployment plan

Use this procedure to create a deployment plan in Desktop Analytics.

1. Open the [Desktop Analytics portal](https://aka.ms/m365aprod). Use credentials that have at least **Workspace Contributors** permissions.  

2. Select **Deployment Plans** in the Manage group.  

3. In the **Deployment Plans** pane, select **Create**.  

4. In the **Create deployment plan** pane, configure the following settings:  

    - **Name**: A unique name for the deployment plan, for example `Office 365 pilot`  

    - **Products and versions**: Select the **Office** product, and the latest available recommended version. For example, **Office 365 clients, version 1808 (recommended)**.  

    - **Device groups**: Select one or more groups, and then select **Set as Target Groups**. Groups with **sccm** as the source are collections synchronized from Configuration Manager.  

    - **Readiness rules**: These rules help to determine which devices qualify for upgrade. Select **Office Applications** and configure the following settings:  

        - Update Office 365 ProPlus from 32-bit to 64-bit. This setting only applies to devices running a 64-bit version of Windows. The default setting is **Yes**.  

        - When updating from an older version of Office, leave older deprecated Office apps. This behavior applies even if those apps don't exist in the newer version of Office. The default setting is **No**.  

        - Low install count threshold for your Office add-ins. The default threshold is `2%`. Add-ins below this threshold are automatically set to *Low install count*. Desktop Analytics doesn't validate these add-ins during the pilot. 

            If an add-in is installed on a higher percentage of computers than this threshold, the deployment plan marks the add-in as *Noteworthy*. Then you can decide its importance to test during the pilot phase.   

    - **Completion date**: Choose the date by which Office should be fully deployed to all the targeted devices.  

5. Select **Create**. The new plan appears in the list of deployment plans while its being processed. Processing can take up to 48 hours before you can proceed to the next step.  

6. Open the deployment plan by selecting its name.  

7. On the deployment plan menu, in the **Prepare** group, select **Identify importance**.  

    1. On the **Office Add-ins** tab, select to show only **Not Reviewed** assets.  

    2. Select each add-in, and then select **Edit**. You can select more than one app to edit at the same time.   

    3. Choose an importance level from the **Importance** list. If you want Desktop Analytics to validate the add-in during the pilot, select **Critical** or **Important**. It doesn't validate add-ins marked as **Not Important**. Consider the compatibility risk and other plan insights when assigning importance levels.  

        When assigning importance levels, you can also choose the Upgrade decision.  

    4. Select **Save** when complete.  

8. On the deployment plan menu, in the **Prepare** group, select **Identify pilot**.  

    1. Review the recommended devices for the pilot.  

    2. Select each device, and select **Add to Pilot**. If you disagree with the recommendation, select **Replace**.  

        For more information on how Desktop Analytics makes these recommendations, select the information icon in the top right corner of the **Identify pilot** pane.
