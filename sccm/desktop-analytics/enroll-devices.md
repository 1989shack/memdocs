# How to enroll devices in Desktop Analytics

When you [connect Configuration Manager](/sccm/desktop-analytics/connect-configmgr) to Desktop Analytics, you configure settings to enroll devices to Desktop Analytics. You can change these settings at any time. Also make sure the devices are up to date.

## Update devices

Desktop Analytics uses two main Windows components:

- **Compatibility component**: The compatibility component (**Appraiser**) runs diagnostics on the Windows device to evaluate its compatibility status with the latest versions of Windows 10.

- **Connected User Experiences and Telemetry service**: With Windows diagnostic data enabled, the Connected User Experience and Telemetry service (**DiagTrack**) collects system, application, and driver data. Microsoft analyzes this data, and shares it back to you via Desktop Analytics.

Install the latest version of these components to get the best experience with Desktop Analytics.

The following table lists the updates for each component on supported OS versions:

| OS version | Appraiser | DiagTrack |
| --------------| ----------------------- | -------------------|
| Windows 10 1909 | Included <sup>[Note 1](#bkmk_note1)</sup> | [Latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4529964) |
| Windows 10 1903 | Included | [Latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4498140) |
| Windows 10 1809 | Included | [Latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4464619) |
| Windows 10 1803 | Included | [Latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4099479) |
| Windows 10 1709 | Included | [Latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4043454) |
| Windows 8.1 | [KB 2976978](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2976978) <sup>[Note 2](#bkmk_note2)</sup> | [Latest monthly rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4009470) |
| Windows 7 SP1 | [KB 2952664](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2952664) <sup>[Note 3](#bkmk_note3)</sup> | [Latest monthly rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4009469) |

> [!TIP]
> Use Configuration Manager to automatically install these updates. For more information, see [Deploy software updates](/sccm/sum/deploy-use/deploy-software-updates).
>
> Restart devices after you install the compatibility updates for the first time.

### <a name="bkmk_note1"></a> Note 1: Windows 10

While Windows 10 includes these components by default, Windows 10 devices require the latest cumulative update to get the full functionality of Desktop Analytics. For example, to assess the device for compatibility against the latest OS version, and to get the near real-time information for deployments and enrollment status.

### <a name="bkmk_note2"></a> Note 2: Windows 8.1

Microsoft regularly increments the updates for this component, but the associated KB number doesn't change. Make sure that you always have the latest version of the update.

This component runs diagnostics on Windows 8.1 systems that participate in the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program. These diagnostics help determine whether you might have compatibility issues when upgrading to Windows 10.

### <a name="bkmk_note3"></a> Note 3: Windows 7

If your organization doesn't apply "Monthly Quality Rollup" updates to Windows 7 devices, and only applies "Security Only" updates, you'll find some "Security Only" updates in the [list of updates superseding KB 2952664](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/ScopedViewInline.aspx?updateid=ad3652cd-2689-4726-b3ef-b086ded23c7c). You can install these newer updates instead of KB 2952664.

> [!NOTE]
> For Windows 8.1, Microsoft only revises KB 2976978 as part of "Monthly Quality Rollup" updates.

## Device enrollment

The Desktop Analytics service has no agents to install. Device enrollment requires configuring settings on the devices you want it to monitor. These settings control to which Desktop Analytics instance the device should send its data, and other configuration options.

> [!Note]  
> If you previously used Windows Analytics, use that same workspace for Desktop Analytics. You need to reenroll devices to Desktop Analytics that you previously enrolled in Windows Analytics.
>
> You can only have one Desktop Analytics workspace per Azure AD tenant. Devices can only send diagnostic data to one workspace.  

Configuration Manager provides an integrated experience for managing and deploying these settings to clients. For the best experience, use Configuration Manager.

When you connect Configuration Manager to Desktop Analytics, you configure the settings to enroll devices. For more information, see [How to connect Configuration Manager with Desktop Analytics](/sccm/desktop-analytics/connect-configmgr#bkmk_connect).

To change these settings, use the following procedure:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Azure Services** node. Select the connection to Desktop Analytics, and choose **Properties** in the ribbon.

2. On the **Diagnostic Data** page, make changes as needed to the following settings:  

    - **Commercial ID**: this value should automatically populate with your organization's ID. If it doesn't, make sure your proxy server is configured to allow all required [endpoints](/sccm/desktop-analytics/enable-data-sharing#endpoints) before continuing. Alternatively, retrieve your Commercial ID manually from the [Desktop Analytics portal](/sccm/desktop-analytics/monitor-connection-health#bkmk_ViewCommercialID).   

    - **Windows 10 diagnostic data level**: For more information, see [Diagnostic data levels](/sccm/desktop-analytics/enable-data-sharing#diagnostic-data-levels).  

    - **Allow Device Name in diagnostic data**: For more information, see [Device name](#device-name).  

    When you make changes to this page, the **Available functionality** page shows a preview of the Desktop Analytics functionality with the selected diagnostic data settings.  

3. On the **Desktop Analytics Connection** page, make changes as needed to the following settings:

    - **Display name**: The Desktop Analytics portal displays this Configuration Manager connection using this name.  

    - **Target collection**: This collection includes all devices that Configuration Manager configures with your commercial ID and diagnostic data settings. It's the full set of devices that Configuration Manager connects to the Desktop Analytics service.  

    - **Devices in the target collection use a user-authenticated proxy for outbound communication**: By default, this value is **No**. If needed in your environment, set to **Yes**. For more information, see [Proxy server authentication](/sccm/desktop-analytics/enable-data-sharing#proxy-server-authentication).  

    - **Select specific collections to synchronize with Desktop Analytics**: Select **Add** to include additional collections from your **Target collection** hierarchy. These collections are available in the Desktop Analytics portal for grouping with deployment plans. Make sure to include pilot and pilot exclusion collections.  <!-- 4097528 -->

        > [!Important] 
        > These collections continue to sync as their membership changes. For example, your deployment plan uses a collection with a Windows 7 membership rule. As those devices upgrade to Windows 10, and Configuration Manager evaluates the collection membership, those devices drop out of the collection and deployment plan.  


### Windows settings

Configuration Manager sets Windows policies in one or both of the following registry keys:

- **GPO**: `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection`

- **Local Policy** preference: `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\DataCollection`

| Policy   | Path | Value  | 
|----------|------|--------|
| **CommercialId** | Local Policy | *Applies to Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10*: In order for a device to show up in Desktop Analytics, configure it with your organizationâ€™s Commercial ID. | 
| **AllowTelemetry**  | GPO | *Applies to Windows 10*: Set `1` for **Basic**, `2` for **Enhanced**, or `3` for **Full** diagnostic data. Desktop Analytics requires at least basic diagnostic data. Microsoft recommends that you use the Enhanced (Limited) level with Desktop Analytics. For more information, see [Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization). |
| **LimitEnhancedDiagnosticDataWindowsAnalytics** | GPO | *Applies to Windows 10, version 1803 and later*: This setting only applies when the AllowTelemetry setting is `2`. It limits the Enhanced diagnostic data events sent to Microsoft to just those events needed by Desktop Analytics. For more information, see [Windows 10 diagnostic data events and fields collected through the limit enhanced diagnostic data policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/enhanced-diagnostic-data-windows-analytics-events-and-fields).|
| **AllowDeviceNameInTelemetry** | GPO | *Applies to Windows 10, version 1803 and later*: A separate opt-in is required to enable devices to continue to send the device name.<br> <br>Note: The device name isn't sent to Microsoft by default. If you don't send the device name, it appears in Desktop Analytics as "Unknown". This behavior can make it difficult to identify and assess devices. For more information, see [Device name](#device-name). | 
| **CommercialDataOptIn** | Local Policy |*Applies to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1*: A value of `1` is required for Desktop Analytics. For more information, see [Commercial Data Opt-in in Windows 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/ee126127\(v=ws.10\)). |
| **RequestAllAppraiserVersions** | Both |*Applies to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1*: A value of `1` is required for Desktop Analytics for data collection to work correctly. | 
| **DisableEnterpriseAuthProxy** | GPO |*Applies to all Windows versions*: A value of `0` is required for Desktop Analytics for data collection to work correctly. | 

> [!Important]  
> In most circumstances, only use Configuration Manager to configure these settings. Don't also apply these settings in domain group policy objects. For more information, see [Conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution).<!-- SCCMDocs-pr 3120 -->

### Device name

Starting in Windows 10, version 1803, the device name is no longer collected by default. Collecting the device name with the diagnostic data requires a separate opt-in. Without the device name, it's more difficult for you to identify what devices require attention while evaluating an upgrade to a new version of Windows.

If you don't send the device name, it appears in Desktop Analytics as "Unknown".

![Desktop Analytics device list showing "unknown" names](media/unknown-device-name.png)

There's an option in the Configuration Manager settings for Desktop Analytics to configure this option: **Allow Device Name in diagnostic data**. This Configuration Manager setting controls the Windows policy setting, AllowDeviceNameInTelemetry.
 

### Conflict resolution

In general, use Configuration Manager collections to target Desktop Analytics settings and enrollment. Use direct membership or queries to include or exclude devices from the collection. For more information, see [How to create collections](/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections).

Configuration Manager only configures the Windows settings if a value doesn't already exist. If you need to configure different settings for a unique group of devices, you can use [group policy](#windows-settings). 

View these settings in the group policy editor at the following path: **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Data Collection and Preview Builds**. Settings targeted by group policy take precedence over Configuration Manager settings.

When you configure the diagnostic data level, you set the upper boundary for the device. By default in Windows 10, version 1803 and later, users can choose to set a lower level. You can control this behavior using the group policy setting, **Configure telemetry opt-in setting user interface**. For more information, see [Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#enterprise-management).
