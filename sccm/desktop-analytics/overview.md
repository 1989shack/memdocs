Introductory paragraph.
> Required:  
> The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is relevant.

> You can go into more detail later in the article. Many services add artwork or videos below the introduction.


(earlier draft)
Desktop Analytics tool provides you with these key benefits relating to Desktop Analytics for the Modern Workplace offerings of Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus:

- Device and software inventory, including apps, add-ins, and macros, versions of Office and Windows, and more.
- Pilot identification, including automatically identifying the smallest set of devices that will provide the widest coverage of apps, add-ins, macros, and other factors important for early piloting. This will allow for efficient and effective piloting of Office and Windows upgrades/updates such that customers can proceed more quickly – and with more confidence – to broad deployments.
- Issue identification and mitigation suggestions, backed by broad market and within-tenant data that is appropriately leveraged to predict where there likely are – and aren’t – issues.
- Tight integration with SCCM, which makes the Desktop Analytics data quickly actionable for deploying and managing Windows and Office.


## article body
> After the intro, you can develop your overview by discussing the features that answer the "Why should I care" question with a bit more depth.  
> Be sure to call out any basic requirements and dependencies, as well as limitations or overhead.  
> Don't catalog every feature, and some may only need to be mentioned as available, without any discussion.


## Top task
> Suggested:  
> An effective way to structure you overview article is to create an H2 for the top customer tasks and describe how the product/service helps customers with that task.  
> Create a new H2 for each task you list.
