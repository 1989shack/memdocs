For customers without a Microsoft support plan contract, use the **Help + Support** option in the Azure portal. This action files an online support ticket for Desktop Analytics. To create and manage a support incident, your account must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role that includes the action **microsoft.office365.supportTickets/tickets/manage**. For more information, see [administrator roles in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles).

If you have a Microsoft support plan contract, go to [Microsoft support](https://aka.ms/cmcbsupport) to open a new support request. Start with the following options:
