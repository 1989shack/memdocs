# Create configuration items for Android and Samsung KNOX devices managed without the System Center Configuration Manager client

  
 Use the System Center Configuration Manager **Android and Samsung KNOX** configuration item to manage settings  for Android and Samsung KNOX devices that are enrolled in Microsoft Intune or managed on-premises by Configuration Manager.  
  
## Create an Android and Samsung KNOX configuration item  
  
1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Assets and compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then click **Configuration Items**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Configuration Item**.  
  
4.  On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.  
  
5.  Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, select **Android and Samsung KNOX**.  
  
6.  Click **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the Configuration Manager console.  
  
7.  On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, select the specific Android or Samsung KNOX platforms that will evaluate the configuration item.  
  
8.  On the **Device Settings** page of the wizard, select the settings group that you want to configure. See [Android and Samsung KNOX configuration item settings reference](#BKMK_setref) in this topic for details, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  If the setting that you want is not listed, select the **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups check box**.  
  
9. On each settings page, configure the settings you require, and whether you want to remediate them when they are not compliant on devices (when this is supported).  
  
10. For each settings group, you can also configure the severity that will be reported when a configuration item is found to be noncompliant from:  
  
    -   **None** - Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Information** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Warning** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Critical** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Critical with event** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. This severity level is also be logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  
  
11. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that are not compatible with the supported platforms you selected earlier. You can go back and remove these settings, or you can continue.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  Unsupported settings are not assessed for compliance.  
  
12. Complete the wizard.  
  
 You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.
