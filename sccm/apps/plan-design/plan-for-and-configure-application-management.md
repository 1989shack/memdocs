# Plan for and configure application management in System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*
Use the information in this topic to help you implement the necessary dependencies for deploying applications in System Center Configuration Manager.  

## Dependencies external to Configuration Manager  

|Dependency|More information|  
|------------------|----------------------|  
|Internet Information Services (IIS) is required on the site system servers that run the Application Catalog website point,  the Application Catalog web service point, the management point, and distribution point.|For more information about this requirement, see [Supported configurations](../../core/plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md).|  
|For mobile devices that are enrolled by Configuration Manager:|When you code sign applications in order to deploy them to mobile devices, do not use a certificate that was generated by using a version 3 template (**Windows Server 2008, Enterprise Edition**). This certificate template creates a certificate that is not compatible with Configuration Manager applications for mobile devices.<br /><br /> If you use Active Directory Certificate Services to code sign applications for mobile device applications, do not use a version 3 certificate template.|  
|Clients must be configured to audit logon events if you want to automatically create user device affinities.|Configuration Manager reads the following two settings from the local security policy on client computers to determine automatic user device affinities:<br /><br /> **Audit account logon events**<br /><br /> **Audit logon events**<br /><br /> To automatically create relationships between users and devices, make sure that these two settings are enabled on client computers. You can use Windows Group Policy to configure these settings.|  

## Configuration Manager dependencies   

|Dependency|More information|  
|------------------|----------------------|  
|Management point|Clients contact a management point to download client policy, to locate content, and to connect to the Application Catalog.<br /><br /> If clients cannot access a management point, they cannot use the Application Catalog.|  
|Distribution point|Before applications can be deployed to clients, you must have at least one distribution point in the hierarchy. By default, the site server has a distribution point site role enabled during a standard installation. The number and location of distribution points will vary according to the specific requirements of your enterprise.<br /><br /> For more information about how to install distribution points and manage content, see [Manage content and content infrastructure](../../core/servers/deploy/configure/manage-content-and-content-infrastructure.md).|  
|Client settings|Many client settings control how applications are installed on the client and the end user experience on the client. These client settings include the following:<br /><br /> - Computer Agent<br /><br /> - Computer Restart<br /><br /> - Software Deployment<br /><br /> - User and Device Affinity<br /><br /> For more information about these client settings, see [About client settings](../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md).<br /><br /> For information about how to configure client settings, see [How to configure client settings](../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md).|  
|For the Application Catalog:<br /><br /> Discovered user accounts|Users must first be discovered by Configuration Manager before they can view and request applications from the Application Catalog. For more information, see [Run discovery](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/run-discovery).|  
|App-V 4.6 SP1 or later client to run virtual applications|To be able to successfully create virtual applications in Configuration Manager, client computers must have the App-V 4.6 SP1 or later client installed.<br /><br /> You must also update the App-V client with the hotfix described in the Knowledge Base [article 2645225](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=237322) before you can successfully deploy virtual applications.|  
|Application Catalog web service point|The Application Catalog web service point is a site system role that provides information about available software from the Software Library to the Application Catalog website.<br /><br /> For information about how to configure this site system role, see [Configure Software Center and the Application Catalog (Windows PCs only)](/sccm/apps/plan-design/plan-for-and-configure-application-management#configure-software-center-and-the-application-catalog-windows-pcs-only) in this topic.|  
|Application Catalog website point|The Application Catalog website point is a site system role that provides users with a list of available software.<br /><br /> For information about how to configure this site system role, see [Configure Software Center and the Application Catalog (Windows PCs only)](/sccm/apps/plan-design/plan-for-and-configure-application-management#configure-software-center-and-the-application-catalog-windows-pcs-only) in this topic.|  
|Reporting services point|To be able to use the reports in Configuration Manager for application management, you must first install and configure a reporting services point.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/manage/reporting.md).|  
|Security permissions for application management|You must have the following security permissions to manage applications.<br /><br /> The **Application Author** security role includes the preceding listed permissions that are required to create, modify and retire applications in Configuration Manager.<br /><br /> **To deploy applications:**<br /><br /> The **Application Deployment Manager** security role includes the preceding listed permissions that are required to deploy applications in Configuration Manager.<br /><br /> The **Application Administrator** security role contains all of the permissions from both the **Application Author** and the **Application Deployment Manager** security roles.<br /><br /> For more information, see  [Configure role-based administration](../../core/servers/deploy/configure/configure-role-based-administration.md).|  

##  Configure Software Center and the Application Catalog (Windows PCs only)  

 In System Center Configuration Manager, you now have two options for how users change settings, browse for, and install applications:  

-   **The new Software Center** - The new Software Center has a new, modern look and apps that would have appeared only in the Silverlight-dependent Application Catalog (user-available apps) now appear in Software Center under the **Applications** tab. The Application Catalog can still be accessed using the link under the **Installation Status** tab of Software Center.  

     You can configure clients to use the new Software Center by enabling the client setting **Computer Agent** > **Use new Software Center**.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Although end users no longer need to connect to the Application Catalog, you must still configure the Application Catalog website point and the Application Catalog web service point as detailed below.  

-   **The previous Software Center and the Application Catalog** - By default, users continue to connect to the previous version of Software Center and connect to the Application Catalog  (Silverlight-enabled web browser required) to browse available applications.  

 Whatever version you choose to use, Software Center is installed automatically when you install the Configuration Manager client on Windows PCs.  

> [!TIP]  
>  The version of  Software Center that users see is based on Configuration Manager client settings. This gives you the flexibility to control which version is used based on custom client settings you deploy to collection.  

## Steps to install and configure the Application Catalog and Software Center  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you perform these steps, make sure that you have met all of the prerequisites listed above.  

|Steps|Details|More information|  
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|  
|**Step 1:** If you will use HTTPS connections, make sure that you have deployed a web server certificate to site system servers.|Deploy a web server certificate to the site system servers that will run the Application Catalog website point and the Application Catalog web service point.<br /><br /> Additionally, if you want clients to access the Application Catalog from the Internet, deploy a web server certificate to at least one management point site system server and configure it for client connections from the Internet.|For information about the certificate requirements, see [PKI certificate requirements](../../core/plan-design/network/pki-certificate-requirements.md).|  
|**Step 2:** If you will use a client PKI certificate for connections to management points, deploy a client authentication certificate to client computers.|Although clients do not have to use a client PKI certificate to connect to the Application Catalog, they must connect to a management point before they can use the Application Catalog. You must deploy a client authentication certificate to client computers in the following scenarios:<br /><br /> - All management points on the intranet accept only HTTPS client connections.<br /><br /> - Clients will connect to the Application Catalog from the Internet.|For information about the certificate requirements, see [PKI certificate requirements](../../core/plan-design/network/pki-certificate-requirements.md).|  
|**Step 3:** Install and configure the Application Catalog web service point and the Application Catalog website.|You must install both of these site system roles in the same site. You do not have to install them on the same site system server or in the same Active Directory forest. However, the Application Catalog web service point must reside in the same forest as the site database.|For more information about site system role placement, see [Plan for site system servers and site system roles](../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-site-system-servers-and-site-system-roles.md).<br /><br /> To configure the Application Catalog web service point and the Application Catalog website point, see **Step 3: Installing and configuring the Application Catalog site system roles**.|  
|**Step 4:** Configure client settings for the Application Catalog and Software Center.|Configure the default client settings if you want all users to have the same setting. Otherwise, configure custom client settings for specific collections.|For more information about client settings, see [About client settings](../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md).<br /><br /> For information about how to configure these client settings, see **Step 4: Configuring the client settings for the Application Catalog and Software Center**.|  
|**Step 5:** Verify that the Application Catalog is operational.|You can access the Application Catalog directly from a browser or from Software Center.|See **Step 5: Verify that the Application Catalog is operational**.|  

## Supplemental procedures to install and configure the Application Catalog and Software Center  
 Use the following information when the steps in the preceding table require supplemental procedures.  

###  Step 3: Installing and configuring the Application Catalog site system roles  
 These procedures configure the site system roles for the Application Catalog. Choose one of the 2 following procedures depending on whether you will install a new site system server or use an existing site system server:  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Application Catalog cannot be installed on a secondary site or on a central administration site.  

####  To install and configure the Application Catalog site systems: New site system server  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Servers and Site System Roles**.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Site System Server**.  

4.  On the **General** page, specify the general settings for the site system, and then click **Next**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  If you want client computers to access the Application Catalog over the Internet, specify the Internet fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  

5.  On the **System Role Selection** page, select **Application Catalog web service point** and **Application Catalog website point** from the list of available roles, and then click **Next**.  

6.  Complete the wizard.  

####  To install and configure the Application Catalog site systems: Existing site system server  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Servers and Site System Roles**, and then select the server to use for the Application Catalog.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Add Site System Roles**.  

4.  On the **General** page, specify the general settings for the site system, and then click **Next**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  If you want client computers to access the Application Catalog over the Internet, specify the Internet fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  

5.  On the **System Role Selection** page, select **Application Catalog web service point** and **Application Catalog website point** from the list of available roles, and then click **Next**.  

6.  Complete the wizard.  

 Verify the installation of these site system roles by using status messages and by reviewing the log files:  

1.  Status messages: Use the components **SMS_PORTALWEB_CONTROL_MANAGER** and **SMS_AWEBSVC_CONTROL_MANAGER**.  

     For example, status ID **1015** for **SMS_PORTALWEB_CONTROL_MANAGER** confirms that Site Component Manager was successfully installed the Application Catalog website point.  

2.  Log files: Search for **SMSAWEBSVCSetup.log** and **SMSPORTALWEBSetup.log**.  

     For more detailed information, search for the log files **awebsvcMSI.log** and **portlwebMSI.log**.  

###  Step 4: Configuring the client settings for the Application Catalog and Software Center  
 This procedure configures the default client settings for the Application Catalog and Software Center that will apply to all devices in the hierarchy. If you want these settings to apply to only some devices, you can create a custom client setting and deploy it to a collection that contains the devices that will have the specific settings. For more information about how to create a custom device setting, see the [How to Create and Deploy Custom Client Settings](../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md#BKMK_CustomClientSettings) section in the [How to configure client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md) topic.  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Administration** > **Client Settings** > **Default Client Settings**.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Properties** group, click **Properties**.  

4.  Review and configure settings that relate to user notifications, the Application Catalog, and Software Center. For example:  

    1.  **Computer Agent** group:  

        -   **Default Application Catalog website point**  

        -   **Add default Application Catalog website to Internet Explorer trusted sites zone**  

        -   **Organization name displayed in Software Center**  

            > [!TIP]  
            >  To specify the organization name displayed in the Application Catalog and configure the website theme, use the **Customization** tab on the Application Catalog website properties.  

        -   **Use new Software Center** - Set to **Yes** if you want to use the new Software Center which allows end users to browse for, and install available apps without the need to access the Application Catalog (which requires a Silverlight-enabled web browser).  

        -   **Install permissions**  

        -   **Show notifications for new deployments**  

    2.  **Power Management** group:  

        -   **Allow users to exclude their device from power management**  

    3.  **Remote Tools** group:  

        -   **Users can change policy or notification settings in Software Center**  

    4.  **User and Device Affinity** group:  

        -   **Allow users to define their primary devices**  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For more information about the client settings, see [About client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md).  

5.  Click **OK** to close the **Default Client Settings** dialog box.  

 Client computers will be configured with these settings when they next download client policy. To initiate policy retrieval for a single client, see [How to manage clients](../../core/clients/manage/manage-clients.md).  

###  Step 5: Verify that the Application Catalog is operational  
 Use the following procedures to verify that the Application Catalog is operational. You can access the Application Catalog directly from a browser or from Software Center.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Application Catalog requires Microsoft Silverlight, which is automatically installed as a Configuration Manager client prerequisite. If you access the Application Catalog directly from a browser by using a computer that does not have the Configuration Manager client installed, first verify that Microsoft Silverlight is installed on the computer.  

> [!TIP]  
>  Missing prerequisites are among the most typical reasons for the Application Catalog to not operate correctly after installation. Confirm the site system role prerequisites for the Application Catalog site system roles. You can do this by using the [Supported configurations](../../core/plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md) topic.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are logged in using a Domain Administrator account, notification messages from the Configuration Manager client (e.g., messages indicating that new software is available) will not be displayed.  

### To access the Application Catalog directly from a browser  

-   In a browser, type the address of the Application Catalog website and confirm that the web page displays with the three tabs: **Application Catalog**, **My Application Requests**, and **My Devices**.  

     Select and use the appropriate address below for the Application Catalog, where <server\> is the computer name, intranet FQDN, or Internet FQDN:  

    -   HTTPS client connections and default site system role settings: **https://<server\>/CMApplicationCatalog**  

    -   HTTP client connections and default site system role settings: **http://<server\>/CMApplicationCatalog**  

    -   HTTPS client connections and custom site system role settings: **https://<server\>:<port\>/<web application name\>**  

    -   HTTP client connections and custom site system role settings: **http://<server\>:<port\>/<web application name\>**  

### To access the Application Catalog from Software Center (does not apply to the new version of Software Center)  

1.  On a client computer, click **Start** > **All Programs** > **Microsoft System Center 2012** > **Configuration Manager** > **Software Center**.  

2.  If you previously configured an organizational name for Software Center as a client setting, confirm that this displays as specified.  

3.  Click **Find additional applications from the Application Catalog** and confirm that the page displays with the three tabs: **Application Catalog**, **My Application Requests**, and **My Devices**.  

> [!WARNING]  
>  After you have installed the Application Catalog site system roles, you will not immediately see the Application Catalog when you click the **Find additional applications from the Application Catalog** link from Software Center. The Application Catalog becomes available from Software Center after the client next downloads its client policy or up to 25 hours after the Application Catalog site system roles are installed.
