# Exchange ActiveSync email profiles in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Email profiles works with Microsoft Intune to let you provision devices with email profiles and restrictions by using Exchange ActiveSync. This lets your users access corporate email on their devices with minimal setup required on their part.  

 You can configure the following device types with email profiles:  

- Windows 10
- Windows Phone 8.1
- Windows Phone 8.0
- iPhones running iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, and iOS 8  
- iPads running iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, and iOS 8  
- Samsung KNOX Standard (4 and later)
- Android for Work

To deploy email profiles to devices, they must be enrolled in Intune. For information about how to get your devices enrolled, see [Manage mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn646962.aspx).

>[!NOTE]
>Intune provides two Android for Work email profiles, one for each of the Gmail and Nine Work email apps. These apps are available in the Google Play Store, and they support connections to Exchange. To enable the email connectivity, deploy one of these email apps to your users' devices, and then create and deploy the appropriate profile. Email apps like Nine Work might not be free. Review the appâ€™s licensing details or contact the app company with any questions.

 In addition to configuring an email account on the device, you can configure synchronization settings for contacts, calendars, and tasks.  

 When you create an email profile, you can include a wide range of security settings, including certificates for identity, encryption, and signing that have been provisioned by using System Center Configuration Manager certificate profiles. For more information about certificate profiles, see [Certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/protect/deploy-use/introduction-to-certificate-profiles).    

## Create an Exchange ActiveSync email profile  

To create a profile, you use the Create Exchange ActiveSync Email Profile Wizard. 

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  

2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, expand **Company Resource Access**, and then click **Email Profiles**.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Exchange ActiveSync Email Profile** to start the wizard.
4.  On the **General** page of the wizard, configure the following:
	- **Name**. Provide a descriptive name for the email profile.
	- **Description**. Optionally, provide a description for the email profile that will help you identify it in the Configuration Manager console.
	- **This email profile is for Android for Work**. Select this option if you will deploy this email profile to only Android for Work devices. If you check this box, the **Supported Platforms** wizard page is not displayed. Only Android for Work email profiles are configured.
4.  On the **Exchange ActiveSync** page of the wizard, specify the following information:  

    -   **Exchange ActiveSync host**. Specify the hostname of your company Exchange Server that hosts Exchange ActiveSync services.  

    -   **Account name**. Specify the display name for the email account as it will be displayed to users on their devices.  

    -   **Account user name**. Select how the email account username is configured on client devices. You can select one of the following options from the drop-down list:  

        -   **User Principal Name**. Use the full user principal name to sign in to Exchange.  

        -   **AccountName**. Use the full user account name from Active Directory.

        -   **Primary SMTP Address**. Use the user's primary SMTP address to sign in to Exchange.  

    -   **Email address**. Select how the email address for the user on each client device is generated. You can select one of the following options from the drop-down list:  

        -   **Primary SMTP Address**. Use the user's primary SMTP address to sign in to Exchange.  

        -   **User Principal Name**. Use the full user principal name as the email address.  

    -   **Account domain**. Choose one of the following options:  

        -   **Obtain from Active Directory**  

        -   **Custom**  

         This field is applicable only if **sAMAccountName** is selected in the **Account user name** drop-down list.  

    -   **Authentication method**. Choose one of the following authentication methods that will be used to authenticate the connection to Exchange ActiveSync:  

        -   **Certificates**. An identity certificate will be used to authenticate the Exchange ActiveSync connection.  

        -   **Username and Password**. The device user must supply a password to connect to Exchange ActiveSync. (The username is configured as part of the email profile.)  

    -   **Identity certificate**. Click **Select** and then select a certificate to use for identity.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  Before you can select the identity certificate, you must first configure it as a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate profile. For more information about certificate profiles, see [Certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/protect/deploy-use/introduction-to-certificate-profiles).  

         This option is available only if you selected **Certificates** under **Authentication method**.  

    -   **Use S/MIME** (for iOS devices only). Send outgoing email by using S/MIME encryption. Choose from the following options:


    	-   **Encryption certificates**. Click **Select** and then select a certificate to use for encryption. This option is applicable to iOS devices only. You can only select a PFX certificate to use as an encryption certificate.

		If you select both an encryption certificate and a signing certificate, these must both be in PFX format.

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  Before you can select certificates, you must first configure them as an SCEP or PFX certificate profile. For more information about certificate profiles, see [Certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/protect/deploy-use/introduction-to-certificate-profiles).
