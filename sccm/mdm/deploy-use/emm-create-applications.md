# Create applications for mobile devices in System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*
A System Center Configuration Manager application has the files and information that are required to deploy software to a device. An application has one or more deployment types that comprise the installation files and information that are required to install software. A deployment type also has rules that specify when and how the software is deployed.  

 You can create applications by using the following methods:  

-   Automatically create the application and deployment types by reading the application installation files.  

-   Manually create the application and then add deployment types later.  

-   Import an application from a file.  

See [Start the create application wizard](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications#start-the-create-application-wizard) for the steps required to create Configuration Manager applications and deployment types.
