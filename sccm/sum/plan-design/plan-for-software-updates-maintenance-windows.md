#  <a name="BKMK_MaintenanceWindow"></a> Plan for a Software Updates Maintenance Window  
 You can add a maintenance window dedicated for software updates installation. This lets you configure a general maintenance window and a different maintenance window for software updates. When a general maintenance window and software updates maintenance window are both configured, clients install software updates only during the software updates maintenance window. For more information about maintenance windows, see [How to use maintenance windows in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/clients/manage/collections/use-maintenance-windows.md).
