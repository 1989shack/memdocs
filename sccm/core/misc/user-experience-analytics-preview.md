## User experience analytics overview

It's not uncommon for end-users to experience long boot times or other disruptions. These disruptions are typically due to a combination of:

- Legacy hardware
- Software configurations that aren't optimized for the end-user experience
- Issues caused by configuration changes and updates

These issues and other end-user experience problems persist because IT doesn't have visibility into the end-user experience

 The root cause of this (and many other end-user experience problems) is that IT has no visibility into the end-user experience aside from the support channel, which is slow, costly and doesnâ€™t provide the right signal on what needs to be optimized. And of course it's not just IT tech-support that bears the cost of these problems; information workers time is also costly, so performance, reliability and support issues that reduce their productivity can have a big impact on an enterprises bottom line as well.
