# Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) for System Center Configuration Manager
During installation of the System Center Configuration Manager console, you have the opportunity to choose to participate in the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** (CEIP). Although CEIP is turned off by default, if it was previously enabled, it will remain enabled.  

-   CEIP is separate from [Diagnostics and usage data for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md).  

-   CEIP is per console, collecting data such as the number of times each element is clicked in the user interface.  

-   Read the [CEIP privacy statement](http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/privacypolicy.mspx?mkt=en-us) online.  

You can change the CEIP settings per console install. In the console, go to the consoles backstage tab (the upper left tab with the drop down arrow)  and select **Customer Experience Improvement Program** to change the settings.
