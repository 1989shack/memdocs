# What&#39;s new in version 1710 of System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Update 1710 for System Center Configuration Manager current branch is available as an in-console update for previously installed sites that run version 1610, 1702, or 1706.

> [!TIP]  
> To install a new site, you must use a baseline version of Configuration Manager.  
>  Learn more about:    
>   - [Installing new sites](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt590197.aspx)  
>   - [Installing updates at sites](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt607046.aspx)  
>   - [Baseline and update versions](/sccm/core/servers/manage/updates#a-namebkmkbaselinesa-baseline-and-update-versions)  

The following sections provide details about changes and new capabilities introduced in version 1710 of Configuration Manager.  

<!--

### Updates for Peer Cache  
Beginning with this release, Peer Cache is no longer a pre-release feature.  No other changes for Peer Cache are introduced with this release. For more information, see  [Peer Cache for Configuration Manager clients](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/client-peer-cache).

### Cloud distribution point support for Azure Government Cloud

## Operating system deployment
 > [!TIP]
 > Beginning with the Windows 10, version 1709 (also known as the Fall Creators Update) release, Windows media includes multiple editions. When configuring a task sequence to use an operating system upgrade package or operating system image, be sure to select an [edition that is supported for use by Configuration Manager](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-10#windows-10-as-a-client).

### Improved VPN Profile Experience in Configuration Manager Console <!-- 1318232 -->

With this release, weâ€™ve updated the VPN profile wizard and properties pages to display settings appropriate for the selected platform:


- Each platform has its own workflow, meaning that new VPN profiles contain only the setting supported by the platform.
- The **Supported Platforms** pages now appears after the **General** page.  You now choose the platform before setting property values.
- When the platform is set to **Android**, **Android for Work**, or **Windows Phone 8.1**, the **Supported platforms** page is not needed and is not displayed.
- The Configuration Manager client-based workflow has been combined with the hybrid mobile device (MDM) client-based Windows 10 workflows; they support the same settings.
- Each platform workflow includes just the settings appropriate for that workflow.  For example, the Android workflow contains settings appropriate for Android; settings appropriate for iOS or Windows 10 Mobile no longer appear in the Android workflow.
- For Windows 8.1 devices, connection types managed by Configuration Manager client only (not supported by Intune) are clearly marked.
- The Automatic VPN page is obsolete and has been removed.

These changes apply to new VPN profiles.  

To minimize compatibility risk, existing VPN profiles are unchanged.  When you edit an existing profile, the settings appear as they did when the profile was created.  

For more information, see [VPN Profiles on mobile devices in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../mdm/deploy-use/create-vpn-profiles.md).
