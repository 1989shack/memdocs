# Removed and deprecated items for System Center Configuration Manager clients

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

This article describes products and operating systems that are removed from support for System Center Configuration Manager clients, or will be removed in a future update (deprecated). This article provides early notice about future changes that might affect your use of Configuration Manager.  

This information is subject to change with future releases, and might not include each deprecated feature, product, or operating system.  

## Deprecated client operating systems  

 Unless noted otherwise, each operating system that is supported as a Configuration Manager client is supported until the Extended Support End Date of that operating system. For details about Extended Support End Dates, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). If Configuration Manager support for an operating system ends prior to the Extended Support End Date, a deprecation date and support removal date for that operating system will be listed here.
