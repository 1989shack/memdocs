# Learn more about the editions of System Center Configuration Manager

The Evaluation edition is based upon the current branch, not LTSB. It is able to be used for evaluation for 180 days.

Purchasing software assurance (SA) is required for the licensed edition of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager and Endpoint Protection. Additional details can be found in the license agreement by which you (or your company) acquired the software. For example, the Microsoft Volume Licensing Product Terms [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=800052](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=800052) (links here: [http://microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?mode=1](http://microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?mode=1)).

This version (1606) of the product requires a current software assurance agreement as of October 1st, 2016. If your software assurance agreement expired prior to October 1st, 2016, it would need to be renewed prior to downloading and installing it, other than in Evaluation mode.

The software assurance expiration date field is an optional field. It is not used for license validation or enforcement by Microsoft. It is a feature provided as a convenience. Since the software also periodically checks for new software updates offered on-line, customers are required to maintain current software assurance license status to be eligible to download these additional updates. This software assurance expiration date that is initially entered, is later made available for reference, so that customer can confirm they are still compliant with their license agreement date before accessing these additional software updates.

Volume license customers can get a summary of their licenses via the Volume License Service Center (VLSC) web site:  [https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). Go to the “Licenses” menu and click “Licenses Summary” for an overview of licenses.

**For more information on accessing VLSC:**

 -  Here’s some training videos on how VLSC works: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/vlsc-training-and-resources.aspx#tab=2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/vlsc-training-and-resources.aspx#tab=2)


 - This video shows where to look up active SA, starting around 43 seconds in: [https://www.microsoft.com/showcase/video.aspx?uuid=fe1846cb-1d26-49fc-b064-57b25dcc31a0 ](https://www.microsoft.com/showcase/video.aspx?uuid=fe1846cb-1d26-49fc-b064-57b25dcc31a0)


 - This one is all about how to get permissions for VLSC. Customers can delegate VLSC read/write perms to other people in their organization: [https://www.microsoft.com/showcase/video.aspx?uuid=ac4ed1ca-d0a9-43cd-89fa-74ccb555dec4](https://www.microsoft.com/showcase/video.aspx?uuid=ac4ed1ca-d0a9-43cd-89fa-74ccb555dec4)

## Current Branch and Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB)
If a customer's software assurance has expired, they must renew SA to continue using the current branch.
If SA is not renewed, but was current as of October 1st, 2016, customers are eligible to use the LTSB installation option. The LTSB has these limitations (link to LTSB doc page, where it documents that  pre-release features, ATP, Cloud Distribution Point, Intune, and Asset Intelligence are the Features limited in LTSB). It will also have the following Support lifecycle (link to page where it states 3yrs support (Oct 2016-Oct 2019), from time of release).

The LTSB option must be installed with a fresh install (or link to support page, if other option). Customers can later upgrade from LTSB, back to current branch. This can be done via a Licensing setting in the Hierarchy Settings. LTSB will not be eligible to upgrade to a future LTSB version. While running LTSB, only critical software updates will be offered via Updates and Servicing. Current Branch software updates will be grayed out. No new features will be offered to LTSB, beyond what was initially installed.
