## <a name="bkmk_insight"></a> Management insight rules for proper HTTPS configuration

<!--6268489-->

This release includes additional [management insight](/configmgr/core/servers/manage/management-insights) rules to help you configure your site for secure HTTPS communication:

- **Sites that don't have proper HTTPS configuration**: This rule lists sites in your hierarchy that's not properly configured for HTTPS. This configuration prevents the site from [synchronizing collection membership results to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups](/configmgr/core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections#bkmk_aadcollsync). It may cause Azure AD sync to not upload all devices. Management of these clients may not function properly.

- **Devices not uploaded to Azure AD**: This rule lists devices that aren't uploaded to Azure AD because the site isn't properly configured for HTTPS.

For either rule, configure [Enhanced HTTP](/configmgr/core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http), or enable at least one management point for HTTPS.
