## <a name="bkmk_attach"></a> Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach: Device sync and device actions
<!--3555758-->
Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. Starting in this release you can upload your Configuration Manager devices to the cloud service and take actions from the Device blade in the admin center.

   - Onboarding creates a third-party app and a first party principal in your Azure AD tenant.
- An Azure public cloud environment.
