## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- The [Check Readiness](/configmgr/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps#BKMK_CheckReadiness) step now includes a check to determine if the device uses UEFI, **Computer is in UEFI mode**.<!--6452769-->

    It also includes a new task sequence variable, **_TS_CRUEFI**. This read-only variable supports the following values:

  - `0`: BIOS
  - `1`: UEFI

- If you enable the [task sequence progress window](/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2002#bkmk_tsprogress) to show more detailed progress information, it now doesn't count enabled steps in a disabled group.<!-- 6448412 --> This change helps make the progress estimate more precise.
