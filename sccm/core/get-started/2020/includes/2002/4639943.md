## <a name="bkmk_ssu"></a> Evaluate software updates after a servicing stack update

<!--4639943-->
Configuration Manager now detects if a servicing stack update (SSU) is part of an installation for multiple updates. When an SSU is detected for installation, it’s installed first. After install of the SSU, a software update evaluation cycle runs to install the remaining updates. This change allows a dependent cumulative update to be installed after the servicing stack update. The device doesn’t need to restart between installs, and you don’t need to create an additional maintenance window.
