## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Additional improvements to task sequence progress

<!--5932692-->

Based on continued feedback from the community, this release includes the following improvements to task sequence progress:

- The count of total steps doesn't include:

  - Groups. This item is a container for other steps, not a step itself.
  - Instances of the **Run task sequence** step. This step is a container for other steps, so are no longer counted.
  - Disabled steps. A disabled step doesn't run during the task sequence, so is no longer counted.

For more information, see the following articles:
