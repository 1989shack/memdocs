## <a name="bkmk_orch"></a> Improvements to Orchestration Groups
<!--3098816-->

Orchestration Groups are the evolution of the "Server Groups" feature. They were first introduced in the [technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 1909](/configmgr/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1909). We improved upon Orchestration groups in [technical preview 2001](/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2001#bkmk_orch) and [technical preview 2001.2](/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2001-2#bkmk_orch). In this technical preview, we've added the following improvements to Orchestration Groups:

- Clear the state, such as **Complete* or *Failed*, for an Orchestration Group member so you can rerun the orchestration.
   - Right-click on the Orchestration Group member and select **Reset Orchestration Group Member**.
- Start some basic operations like **Resource Explorer** and **Enable Verbose Logging** for selected members.
- Updates requiring restarts now work with orchestration.
