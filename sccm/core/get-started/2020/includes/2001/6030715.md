## <a name="bkmk_wake"></a> Wake up a device from the central administration site

<!--6030715-->

From the central administration site (CAS), in the **Devices** or **Device Collections** node, you can now use the client notification action to **Wake Up** devices. This action was previously only available from a primary site. For more information, see [How to configure Wake on LAN](/configmgr/core/clients/deploy/configure-wake-on-lan#bkmk_wol-1810).
