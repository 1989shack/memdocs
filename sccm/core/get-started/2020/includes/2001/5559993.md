## <a name="bkmk_onetrace"></a> OneTrace log groups

<!--5559993-->

[OneTrace](/configmgr/core/support/support-center-onetrace) now supports customizable log groups, similar to the feature in Support Center. Log groups allow you to open all log files for a single scenario. OneTrace currently supports groups for the following scenarios:

- Application Management
- Compliance Settings
- Software Updates

You can also customize these groups by modifying the configuration XML.

For more information about log groups in Support Center, see [User interface reference](/configmgr/core/support/support-center-ui-reference#bkmk_support-logs).

For more information about customizing log groups, see [Customize Support Center](/configmgr/core/support/support-center-customize). The same instructions apply to OneTrace.
