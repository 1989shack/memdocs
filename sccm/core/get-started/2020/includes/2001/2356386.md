## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Improvements to task sequence progress

<!--2356386-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/33666679-add-the-complete-progression-status-in-the-progres), the task sequence progress window includes the following improvements:

- Show the current step number, total number of steps, and percent completion
- Increased the width of the window to give you more space to better show the organization name in a single line

> [!NOTE]
> The count and percentage complete are intended for general guidance purposes only. These values are based on the total number of steps in the task sequence. For more complex task sequence with disabled steps or groups, or steps that run conditionally based on task sequence logic, the progress may be non-linear.
>
> For example, your task sequence has 10 steps, and you disable steps #3 through #7. The task sequence progress initially shows `1 of 10 (10%)`, then `2 of 10 (20%)`, and then jumps to `8 of 10 (80%)`.
