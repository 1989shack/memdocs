## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Improvements to task sequence progress

<!--2356386-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/33666679-add-the-complete-progression-status-in-the-progres), the task sequence progress window includes the following improvements:

- Show the current step number, total number of steps, and percent completion
- Increased the width of the window to give you more space to better show the organization name in a single line
