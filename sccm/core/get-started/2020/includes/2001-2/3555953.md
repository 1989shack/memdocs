## <a name="bkmk_tsdt"></a> Improvements to task sequence as a deployment type

<!--3555953-->

Technical preview version 1905 included the initial release of the task sequence as an app model deployment type. This feature allows you to install complex applications using task sequences via the application model. It provides the following benefits:

- Deploy an app task sequence to a user collection

- Display the app task sequence with an icon in Software Center. An icon makes it easier for users to find and identify the app task sequence.

- Define additional metadata for the app task sequence, including localized information

This release includes the client-side functionality, so you can now see the deployment in Software Center. After you update the site, make sure to also update the client to the latest version.

For more information including prerequisites and set up instructions, see [task sequence as an app model deployment type](/configmgr/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1905#bkmk_tsdt).
