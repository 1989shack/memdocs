## <a name="bkmk_subnet"></a> Exclude certain subnets for peer content download

<!--3555777-->

Boundary groups include the following option for peer downloads: **During peer downloads, only use peers within the same subnet**. If you enable this option, the management point only includes in the content location list peer sources that are in the same subnet as the client. For more information on this option, see [Boundary group options for peer downloads](/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/boundary-groups#bkmk_bgoptions).

Depending on the configuration of your network, you can now exclude certain subnets. For example, you want to include a boundary but exclude a specific VPN subnet. By default, Configuration Manager excludes the default Teredo subnet (`2001:0000:%`).

Import your subnet exclusion list as a comma-separated string. The site uses this string in a SQL `like` expression. On the primary site server, set or read the **SubnetExclusionList** embedded property for the **SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER** component in the **SMS_SCI_Component** class. For more information, see [SMS_SCI_Component server WMI class](/configmgr/develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_sci_component-server-wmi-class).
