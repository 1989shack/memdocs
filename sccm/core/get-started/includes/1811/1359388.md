## <a name="bkmk_tsmedia"></a> Specify temp storage for task sequence media creation 
<!--1359388-->

This improvement is based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/34061488-specify-drive-to-cache-data-for-creating-task-sequ). 

When you create task sequence media, now customize the location that the site uses for temporary storage of data. This process can require much temporary drive space. This change gives you greater flexibility to choose where to store these temporary files. 

In the **Create Task Sequence Media Wizard**, specify a location for the **Staging folder**. By default this location is similar to the following path: `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp`.
