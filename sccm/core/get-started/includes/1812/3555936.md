## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Download reports from the Community Hub
<!--3555936-->
This release iterates on the [Community Hub](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1807#bkmk_hub) by adding support for reports. When you download a report from the hub, Configuration Manager installs it to the reporting point. You'll see downloaded reports from the community in a new **Hub** folder under reports. 

> [!Note]  
> It can take up to 10 minutes before a downloaded report is available on the reporting point.
