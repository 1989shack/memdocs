## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Download reports from the Community Hub
<!--3555936-->
This release iterates on the [Community Hub](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1807#bkmk_hub) by adding support for reports. When you download a report from the hub, Configuration Manager installs it to the reporting point. You'll see downloaded reports from the community in a new **Hub** folder under reports. 

> [!Note]  
> It can take up to 10 minutes before a downloaded report is available on the reporting point.


### Prerequisite

- Enable the SMS Provider to use a certificate. Use one of the following options:  

    - Enable [Enhanced HTTP](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http) (recommended)  

    - Manually bind a PKI-based certificate to port 443 in IIS on the server that hosts the SMS Provider role  


### Known issues

- Enhanced HTTP only works with this scenario for the console on the site server. If you need to use a console remote from the site server, use the second option to install a certificate on the SMS Provider.  

- If the hub fails to download a report, the console doesn't display an error message. It displays a success message when the site successfully downloads and installs the report.
