## <a name="bkmk_impact"></a> Replace toast notifications with dialog window
<!--3555947-->

Sometimes users don't see the Windows toast notification about a restart or required deployment. Then they don't see the experience to snooze the reminder. This behavior can lead to a poor user experience when the client reaches a deadline.

Now when deployments need a restart or software changes are required, you have the option of using a more intrusive dialog window. The following table compares the experiences for each scenario:

| Notification type | Required deployment | Required restart |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Toast  | ![Toast notification that Software changes are required](../../media/3555947-required-toast.png) | ![Toast notification that Restart required](../../media/3555947-restart-toast.png) |
| Dialog | ![Dialog window for Required software changes](../../media/3555947-required-dialog.png) | ![Dialog window to Restart your computer](../../media/3555947-restart-dialog.png) |


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.


#### Software changes are required

1. Deploy an [application](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications), [task sequence](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/manage-task-sequences-to-automate-tasks#BKMK_DeployTS), or [software update](/sccm/sum/deploy-use/deploy-software-updates) as required with a deadline in the future.  

2. On the **User Experience** page of the Deploy Software Wizard, select the user notification option to **Display in Software Center and show all notifications**. Then select the following option: **When software changes are required, show a dialog window to the user instead of a toast notification**.  

3. Complete the Deploy Software Wizard.


#### Restart required

1. Edit client settings. For more information, see [How to configure client settings](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/configure-client-settings).  

2. In the **Computer Restart** group, enable the following option: **When a deployment requires a restart, show a dialog window to the user instead of a toast notification**.  

3. Create a required deployment for a software item that requires a restart.
