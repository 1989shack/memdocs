## Office 365 ProPlus Pilot and Health Dashboard
<!--3608345-->
There's a new experience to help admins create pilot collections for getting started with Office 365 ProPlus deployments. We know from customer feedback that many enterprises don't immediately deploy Office 365 ProPlus. Instead, they prefer to run a pilot on a small set of devices before completing their rollout. The Office 365 ProPlus Pilot and Health Dashboard provides a recommendation for pilot devices based on add-in inventory.

### Generate pilot

Generate a pilot recommendation from a limiting collection at the click of a button. As soon as the action is launched, a background task starts calculating your pilot collection. Your limiting collection must contain at least one device with an Office version that is not ProPlus.

### Recommended pilot devices

**Recommended pilot devices** is a minimal set of devices representing all installed add-ins across your generated pilot's limiting collection. Drill down to get a list of these devices and use the details to exclude any devices, if needed.

### Deploy pilot

Once you accept all pilot devices, next recommendation is to deploy the pilot collection using the phased deployment wizard. User can define pilot and limiting collection in the wizard to manage deployments.

After you deploy office Proplus 365 on pilot devices, you can enable health data on these devices to get insights on add-in and macro not meeting health goals. Ready to deploy chart helps you know about the non-pilot devices which are now ready for proplus based on health insights. There is also a chart to let users know the count of devices of sending health data.
