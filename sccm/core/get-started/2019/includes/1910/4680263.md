## <a name="bkmk_4680263"></a> New task sequence variable for Windows 10 in-place upgrade

<!--4680263-->

Some customers have reported issues with the Window 10 in-place upgrade task sequence after the final restart. The TSManager component records entries similar to the following errors in the smsts.log:

``` log
Failed to initate policy evaluation for namespace 'root\ccm\policy\machine', hr=0x80041010
Error compiling client config policies. code 80041010
Task Sequence Manager could not initialize Task Sequence Environment. code 80041010
```

To address this issue, you can now specify a new task sequence variable **SetupCompletePause**. When you assign a value in seconds to this variable, the Windows setup process delays that amount of time before it starts the task sequence. This timeout allows the Configuration Manager client additional time to initialize its WMI classes.
