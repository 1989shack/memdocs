## Improvements to Console Connections
<!--4923997-->
We've made the following improvements to **Console Connections**:

- The ability to message other administrators through Microsoft Teams.
- The **Last Console Heartbeat** column has replaced the **Last Connected Time** column.
  - An open console in the foreground sends a heartbeat every 10 minutes.


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Go to **Administration** > **Security** > **Console Connections**.
1. Notice the column **Last Console Heartbeat** has replaced the **Last Connected Time** column.
1. Right-click on a user's console connection and select **Message Admin**.
    - If Microsoft Teams is installed on the device from which you run the console, it will open a chat with the user.
    - An error message including the download link appears if Microsoft Teams isn't installed.
