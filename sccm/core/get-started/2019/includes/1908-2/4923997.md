## View active consoles and message administrators through Console Connections
<!--4923997-->
View active consoles and message administrators through Console Connections.

 This feature adds the ability to message administrators, and adds a column "Last Console Heartbeat" in the Console Connections node.


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Go to **Administration** > **Security** > **Console Connections**.
1. Notice the column **Last Console Heartbeat** has replaced the **Last Connected Time** column.
1. Right-click on a user's console connection and select **Message Admin**.
  - If Microsoft Teams is installed on the device from which you run the console, it will open a chat with the user.
  - An error message including the download link appears if Microsoft Teams isn't installed.
