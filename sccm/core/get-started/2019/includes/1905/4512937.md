## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment

<!--4512937,4224642-->

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/18951715-add-reboot-count-functionality-to-the-disable-bitl), the [Disable BitLocker](/sccm/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps#BKMK_DisableBitLocker) task sequence step has a new restart counter. Instead of adding multiple instances of this step, now increment this counter.

- Technical preview version 1904 included a feature to [Pre-cache driver packages and OS images](/sccm/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1904#bkmk_precache). This version improves upon that functionality by also adding packages. Specify the architecture and language of the package on its properties.
