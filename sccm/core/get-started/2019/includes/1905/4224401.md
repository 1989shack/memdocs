## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Improvements to Community Hub

<!--4224401-->

This release includes the following improvements to the Community Hub:

- Aside from the existing support for scripts and reports, it now supports the following objects:  

    - Task sequences
    - Applications
    - Configuration items  

    > [!Note]  
    > The hub doesn't share any content associated with these objects.
    >
    > The hub currently doesn't support object dependencies. For example, if you share app A that is dependent upon app B, it only shares app A with the community. Similarly, if a task sequence includes the Install Application step, the referenced apps aren't shared.

<!-- What about task sequences secrets? -->

- It now manages updates to shared objects. There are two use cases for this scenario:  

    - You've downloaded an object from the hub. When you visit its entry in the Community Hub, the hub detects that you have an older version of the object. You can update it in your site with the latest version from the hub.

    - You created an object in your site, and share it in the hub. You then revise it in your site. When you revisit **My Hub**, because the version changed, you can update the object in the hub.
