## <a name="bkmk_aadcollsync"></a> Synchronize collection membership results to Azure Active Directory groups
<!--3607475-->
When you onboard a Configuration Manager site to Microsoft Intune via co-management, an admin can enable the synchronization of a collection membership to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group. This synchronization allows you to use your existing on premises grouping rules in the cloud. You can synchronize both user and device collections. Your new Azure AD group is automatically named using the Configuration Manager collection name and is given the collection ID as the group description.

The Azure AD synchronization is one way, from Configuration Manager to Azure AD. Changes made in Azure AD aren't reflected in Configuration Manager collections and will be overwritten next time Configuration Manager syncs. 

### Prerequisites

- [Co-management must be enabled](/sccm/comanage/how-to-enable)

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select either the **User Collections** or **Device Collections** node.
1. Click on the collection you want to create an Azure AD group from, then click on **Properties** in the ribbon.
1. In the **Cloud Sync** tab, select one or more Azure AD tenants to synchronize your collection membership results.
1. Click **OK**. 
1. After the initial synchronization occurs, you can review your new Azure AD group from the [Azure portal](https://https://portal.azure.com).
