## <a name="bkmk_console"></a> Improvements to Configuration Manager console

<!--4616810-->

Based on customer feedback at the Midwest Management Summit (MMS) 2019, this release includes the following improvements to the Configuration Manager console:

#### Collections tab in devices node

In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, go to the **Devices** node, and select a device. In the details pane, switch to the new **Collections** tab. This tab lists the collections that include this device.

#### Task sequences tab in applications node

In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, go to the **Applications** node, and select an application. In the details pane, switch to the new **Task sequences** tab. This tab lists the task sequences that reference this application.

#### Show collection name for scripts

In the **Monitoring** workspace, select the **Script Status** node. It now lists the **Collection Name** instead of the ID.

#### Cloud management dashboard color consistency

In the **Monitoring** workspace, select the **Cloud Management** node. The colors in the donut chart for **Current online clients** are now the same as the graph of **Online clients (Last 30 days)**.
