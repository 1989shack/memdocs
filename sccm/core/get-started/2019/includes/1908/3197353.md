## Local device express query evaluation for CMPivot standalone
<!--3197353-->
When using CMPivot outside of the Configuration Manager console, you can express query just the local device without need for the Configuration Manager infrastructure. This change means CMPivot standalone runs independently of Configuration Manager using Kusto queries to get information from WMI. CMPivot standalone is a [pre-release feature](/sccm/core/servers/manage/pre-release-features#bkmk_table) and is only available in English. For more information about installing CMPivot standalone, see [Install CMPivot standalone](/sccm/core/servers/manage/cmpivot#install-cmpivot-standalone).
