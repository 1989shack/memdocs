## <a name="bkmk_tssearch"></a> Improvements to task sequence editor search

<!--4621085-->

This release includes the following improvements to the version 1907 feature to [search the task sequence editor](/sccm/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1907#bkmk_tsedit):

- Use **Alt** + **Down arrow** to open the search options.

- Select the **Scope** list to choose the areas of the task sequence editor to search.

- Instead of scoping the search to the **Group**, you can now search on **Group Name** or **Group Description**.
