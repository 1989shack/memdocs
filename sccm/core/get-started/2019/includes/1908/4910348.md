## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment

Based in your UserVoice feedback, this release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- ([UserVoice reference](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/35370691-ability-to-specify-the-keyboard-layout-in-the-boot))<!-- 4910348 --> On the **Customization** tab of a boot image, use the new option to **Set default keyboard layout in WinPE**. When the task sequence uses the boot image...

    > [!Note]
    > The [Set-CMBootImage](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/configurationmanager/set-cmbootimage?view=sccm-ps) PowerShell cmdlet now includes a new parameter, `-InputLocale`. For example:
    >
    > ```PowerShell
    > # Set boot image keyboard layout to Russian (Russia)
    > Set-CMBootimage -Id "CM100004" -InputLocale "ru-ru"`
    > ```

- ([UserVoice reference](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/37927843-store-output-of-run-command-line-to-tsenv-with-ru))<!-- 4798352  --> The **Run Command Line** step now includes an option to **Output to task sequence variable**. When you enable this option, the task sequence saves the output from the command to a custom task sequence variable that you specify.

    > [!Note]  
    > Configuration Manager now limits this output to the last one thousand characters. This change applies to both the **Run Command Line** and **Run Powershell Script**. For more information, see [About task sequence steps](/sccm/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps) steps.
