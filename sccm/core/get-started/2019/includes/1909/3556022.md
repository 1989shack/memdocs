## <a name="bkmk_Azure-migration"></a> Extend and migrate on-premises Configuration Manager environments to Microsoft Azure
<!--3556022-->

The **Extend and Migrate ConfigMgr Site System roles to Azure** tool will help you to programmatically, create Azure VMs and install Configuration Manager Site system roles like passive site server, MPs, and DPs, with default settings in Azure. Once the new roles are created and validated by you, you can keep them as additional site systems for high availability, or remove the site system role from on-premises and move the role to Azure only.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription
- Azure virtual network with ExpressRoute gateway
- Configuration Manager version 1806 or higher
- A standalone environment and not in a hierarchy
  - CAS and hierarchy environments are not currently supported.
- The tool should only be install and run on the primary site server
- The user running the tool needs to be a Configuration Manager Admin and have administrator rights on the primary site server.
