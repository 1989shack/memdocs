## <a name="bkmk_OGs"></a> Orchestration Groups
<!--3098816-->

The **Orchestration Groups** feature is the evolution of the [Server Groups](/sccm/sum/deploy-use/service-a-server-group) feature. It's a brand new entity in Configuration Manager. When you create an orchestration group, you can service it with your rules including "before" and "after" scripts that you define.

### Prerequisites

Enable the **Orchestration Groups** feature from **Administration** > **Updates and Servicing** > **Features**. When you enable **Orchestration Groups**, it will block the **Server Groups** feature so there won't be any conflicts between the two features.

### Permissions
To see all of the orchestration groups and updates for those groups, the following permissions are needed:
- Collections permissions?
- SUM/SUG permissions?

### Log files
- Log1.log
- Log2.log

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.
