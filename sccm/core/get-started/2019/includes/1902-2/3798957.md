## <a name="bkmk_ehttp"></a> Hierarchy support for enhanced HTTP
<!--3798957-->

You can now enable [enhanced HTTP](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http) per primary site or for the entire hierarchy. This change provides better support for features that require it. For example, [app approvals via email](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/app-approval#bkmk_email-approve) or [viewing recently connected consoles](/sccm/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1901#bkmk_console).

To enable enhanced HTTP for the hierarchy:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.  

2. Expand **Site Configuration** and select the **Sites** node.  

3. Select the central administration site server, and choose **Properties** in the ribbon.  

4. On the General tab, select the option to **Use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems**.
