## <a name="bkmk_cache"></a> Microsoft Connected Cache support for Intune Win32 apps

<!--5032900-->

When you enable Microsoft Connected Cache on your Configuration Manager distribution points, they can now serve Microsoft Intune Win32 apps to co-managed clients.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration Manager current branch version 1906 included [Delivery Optimization In-Network Cache](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/delivery-optimization-in-network-cache), an application installed on Windows Server that's still in development. Starting in technical preview branch version 1911 this feature is now called **Microsoft Connected Cache**.
>
> When you install Connected Cache on a Configuration Manager distribution point, it offloads Delivery Optimization service traffic to local sources. Connected Cache does this behavior by efficiently caching content at the byte range level.
