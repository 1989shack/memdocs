## More frequent countdown notifications for restarts
<!--3976435-->
The following improvements have been made for computer restart notifications:

1. In **Client Settings** on the **Computer Restart** page, you can now **Specify the snooze duration for computer restart countdown notifications (hours)**.
      - **Display a temporary notification to the user that indicates the interval before the user is logged off or the computer restarts (minutes)** should be set to a value greater than the snooze duration.
      - The default value is 4 hours.
2. The maximum value for **Display a temporary notification to the user that indicates the interval before the user is logged off or the computer restarts (minutes)** increased from 1440 minutes (24 hours) to 20160 minutes (two weeks).
3. The user won't see a progress bar in the restart notification until the pending restart is less than 24 hours away.
