## <a name="bkmk_winsku"></a> Support for Windows Virtual Desktop

<!--3556025-->

[Windows Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/) is a preview feature of Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. You can now use Configuration Manager technical preview to manage these virtual devices running Windows 10 in Azure.

Similar to a terminal server, these virtual devices allow multiple concurrent active user sessions. To help with client performance, Configuration Manager now disables user policies on a terminal server-type device. Even if you generally enable user policies for clients, they're disabled by default on these types of devices. For an existing client of this type that you update to this version, the previous behavior persists.

If you require user policy in this scenario, and accept any potential performance impact, use the Configuration Manager SDK to enable the following client setting: **Request User Policy On TS**.
