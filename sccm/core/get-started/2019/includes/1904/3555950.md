## <a name="bkmk_swctr"></a> Software Center infrastructure improvements

<!--3555950-->

This release includes the following infrastructure improvements to Software Center:

- For apps targeted to users as available, Software Center now gets them from the management point. It does this behavior even if the site has application catalog roles. This change makes it easier for you to remove these site roles.  

- Previously, Software Center picked the first management point from the list of available servers. Starting in this release, it uses the same management point that the client uses. This change allows Software Center to align with the client, and have the same fallback behavior.
