## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot"></a> CMPivot standalone
<!--3555890-->

You can now use CMPivot as a standalone tool. Run it outside of the Configuration Manager console to view the real-time state of devices in your environment. This change enables you to use CMPivot on a device without first installing the console. For example, a business analyst who doesn't have the console installed on their computer can use CMPivot to query the site.
