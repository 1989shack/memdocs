## <a name="bkmk_cmg"></a> Stop cloud service when it exceeds threshold
<!--3735092-->

Configuration Manager can now stop a cloud management gateway (CMG) service when the outbound data transfer goes over your limit. The CMG has always had [alerts](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/monitor-clients-cloud-management-gateway#set-up-outbound-traffic-alerts), to trigger notifications when the usage reached warning or critical levels. To help reduce any unexpected Azure costs due to a spike in usage, this new option turns off the cloud service. 

> [!Important]  
> Even if the service isn't running, there are still costs associated with the cloud service. Stopping the service doesn't eliminate all associated Azure costs. To remove all cost for the cloud service, [remove the CMG](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway#modify-a-cmg).  
> 
> When the CMG service is stopped, internet-based clients can't communicate with Configuration Manager.  


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Set up outbound traffic alerts](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/monitor-clients-cloud-management-gateway#set-up-outbound-traffic-alerts)  

2. Enable the option to **Stop this service when it exceeds the critical threshold**.  

3. To test this option, temporarily reduce the **Percentage of threshold for raising Critical alert**. (The default value is `90`.)
