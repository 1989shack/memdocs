## <a name="bkmk_arm"></a> Use Azure Resource Manager for cloud services
<!--3605704-->

Starting in Configuration Manager current branch version 1810, the classic service deployment in Azure is deprecated for use in Configuration Manager. That version is the last to support creation of these Azure deployments. 

Starting in this technical preview branch version, Azure Resource Manager is the only deployment mechanism for new instances of the cloud management gateway and cloud distribution point. Existing deployments continue to work, but you should plan to move your cloud management gateway and cloud distribution points to Azure Resource Manager deployments.

For more information on redeploying the services, see the following articles:

- [Redeploy cloud management gateway](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway#redeploy-the-service)  
- [Redeploy cloud distribution point](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/install-cloud-based-distribution-points-in-microsoft-azure#redeploy-the-service)
