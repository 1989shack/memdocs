## <a name="bkmk_console"></a> View recently connected consoles 
<!--3699367-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/12508299-active-admin-consoles), you can now view the most recent connections for the Configuration Manager console. The view includes active connections and those that recently connected. 


<!-- 

- does it include your connection?
- does it include SDK connections?
- do we purge the list? or does it just grow over time?
 -->
