## <a name="bkmk_console"></a> View recently connected consoles 
<!--3699367-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/12508299-active-admin-consoles), you can now view the most recent connections for the Configuration Manager console. The view includes active connections and those that recently connected. 


### Prerequisites

- Your account needs the **Read** permission on the **SMS_Site** object  


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.  

2. Expand **Security** and select the **Console Connections** node.  

3. View the recent connections, with the following properties:  

    - User name
    - Machine name
    - Connected site code
    - Console version
    - Last connected time: When the user last *opened* the console

You'll always see your current console connection in the list. It only shows connections from the Configuration Manager console, not PowerShell or other SDK-based connections to the SMS Provider. The site removes instances from the list that are older than 30 days.
