## Client Log Collection

You can now trigger a client device to upload its client logs to the site server by sending a client notification action from the Configuration Manager console.

### Permissions for client log collection

To collect client logs, your administrative user needs:

- **Notify resource** permission on the **Collection**
  - The Full Administrator and Operations Administrator built-in roles have this permission by default. 


### Log files

- Diagnostics.log

A client notification message is sent to the selected clients to gather the CCM logs. The logs are returned using software inventory file collection. You can also select **Collect Client Logs**  under **Client Diagnostics** from either the **Device Collections** or **Devices** node using the ribbon.


#### View client logs

1. From the **Devices** node, right-click on the device you want to view logs for.
1. Select **Start**, then **Resource Explorer**. 
1. From **Resource Explorer**, expand **Software** and select **Collected files**. 
1. In the **Collected Files** list, the name format of the client logs is `Support_<guid>.zip`.
1. Right-click on the zip file and select one of the following options:
    - **View file**: Opens the folder where the zip file is located with File Explorer.
    - **Save**: Opens a Save File dialog for the selected file.
