## <a name="bkmk_provisionts"></a> Bootstrap a task sequence immediately after client registration

<!--5526972-->

When you install and register a new Configuration Manager client, and also deploy a task sequence to it, it's difficult to determine how soon after registration it will run the task sequence. This release introduces a new client setup property that you can use to start a task sequence on a client after it successfully registers with the site.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Create a non-OS deployment task sequence](/configmgr/osd/deploy-use/create-a-task-sequence-for-non-operating-system-deployments)) to install apps, install software updates, and configure settings. Note the task sequence ID, for example `PRI20001`.

1. [Deploy this task sequence](/configmgr/osd/deploy-use/deploy-a-task-sequence) to the new built-in collection, **All Provisioning Devices**.

1. [Install the Configuration Manager client](/configmgr/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers#BKMK_Manual) on a device, and include the following property: `PROVISIONTS=PRI20001`. Set the value of this property as the task sequence ID.

After the client installs and properly registers with the site, it starts the referenced task sequence. If client registration fails, the task sequence won't start.
