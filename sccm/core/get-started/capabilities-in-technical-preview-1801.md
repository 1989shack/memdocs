# Capabilities in Technical Preview 1801 for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Technical Preview)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager, version 1801. You can install this version to update and add new capabilities to your Configuration Manager technical preview site. 

Review [Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/core/get-started/technical-preview) before installing this version of the technical preview. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

**Known Issues in this Technical Preview:**
-   **Update to a new preview version fails when you have a site server in passive mode**. If you have a [primary site server in passive mode](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1706#site-server-role-high-availability), then you must uninstall the passive mode site server before updating to this new preview version. You can reinstall the passive mode site server after your site completes the update.

  To uninstall the passive mode site server:
  1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration** > **Overview** > **Site Configuration** > **Servers and Site System Roles**, and then select the passive mode site server.
  2. In the **Site System Roles** pane, right-click on the **Site server** role, and then choose **Remove Role**.
  3. Right-click on the passive mode site server, and then choose **Delete**.
  4. After the site server uninstalls, on the active primary site server restart the service **CONFIGURATION_MANAGER_UPDATE**.

## Create phased deployments
Phased deployments automate a coordinated, sequenced rollout of software without creating multiple deployments. In this Technical Preview version, the phased deployment wizard can be completed for task sequences in the admin console. However, deployments are not created.

1. Websites can be given access to the hostâ€™s virtual graphics processor. 
2. Files downloaded inside the container can be persisted on the host. </br>

## Improvements to Run Scripts
The [**Run Scripts** feature](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts) now allows you to import and run signed PowerShell scripts. 
- To keep the script integrity, signed scripts must be imported rather than using copy/paste. 
- Imported signed scripts cannot be edited after import.
<!--1236459_import_signed_scripts--->
<!--1236459_import_signed_scripts POSSIBLE ISSUE, waiting on confirmation
[!IMPORTANT] In this Technical Preview, there is a temporary limitation where scripts can only be imported in the Run Scripts feature and can't be edited directly from the console.
