# Set up cloud management gateway for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*  

This process includes the steps required to set up a cloud management gateway (CMG). 

> [!Tip]
> This feature was first introduced in version 1610 as a [pre-release feature](/sccm/core/servers/manage/pre-release-features). Beginning with version 1802, this feature is no longer a pre-release feature.



## Before you begin

Start by reading the article [Plan for cloud management gateway](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway). Use that article to determine your CMG design. 

Use the following checklist to make sure you have the necessary information and prerequisites to create a CMG:  

- The Azure environment to use. For example, the Azure Public Cloud or the Azure US Government Cloud.  

- You need one or more certificates for CMG, depending upon your design. For more information, see [Certificates for cloud management gateway](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway).  

- Starting in version 1802, choose whether you use the **Azure Resource Manager deployment** or a **classic service deployment**. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway#azure-resource-manager). You need the following requirements for an Azure Resource Manager deployment of CMG:  

    - Integration with [Azure AD](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard) for **Cloud Management**. Azure AD user discovery is not required.  

    - A subscription admin needs to log on.  

- You need the following requirements for a classic service deployment of CMG:  

    - Azure subscription ID  

    - Azure management certificate  

- A globally unique name for the service. This name is from the [CMG server authentication certificate](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway#cmg-server-authentication-certificate).  

- The Azure region for this CMG deployment.  

- How many VM instances you need for scale and redundancy.  



## Set up a CMG

Perform this procedure on the top-level site. That site is either a standalone primary site, or the central administration site.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select **Cloud Management Gateway**.  

2. Click **Create Cloud Management Gateway** in the ribbon.  

3. Starting in version 1802, on the General page of the wizard, first choose the CMG deployment method, **Azure Resource Manager deployment** or **Classic service deployment**.  

    1. For the **Azure Resource Manager deployment**: Click **Sign in** to authenticate with an Azure subscription administrator account. The wizard auto-populates the remaining fields from the information stored during the Azure AD integration prerequisite. If you own multiple subscriptions, select the **Subscription ID** of the desired subscription to use.  

    2. For the **classic service deployment**, *and Configuration Manager versions 1706 and 1710*: enter your Azure **Subscription ID**. Then click **Browse** and select the .PFX file for the Azure management certificate. 

4. Specify the **Azure environment** for this CMG. The options in the drop-down list may vary depending upon the deployment method.  

5. Click **Next**. Wait as the site tests the connection to Azure.  

4. On the Settings page of the wizard, first click **Browse** and select the .PFX file for the CMG server authentication certificate. The name from this certificate populates the required **Service FQDN** and **Service name** fields.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Starting in version 1802, the CMG server authentication certificate supports wildcards. If you use a wildcard certificate, replace the asterisk (\*) in the **Service FQDN** field with the desired hostname for the CMG.  
   <!--491233-->  

5. Click the **Region** drop-down list to choose the Azure region for this CMG.  

6. In version 1802, and are using an Azure Resource Manager deployment, select a **Resource Group** option. 
   1. If you choose **Use existing**, then select an existing resource group from the drop-down list.
   2. If you choose **Create new**, then enter the new resource group name.

6. In the **VM Instance** field, enter the number of VMs for this service. The default is one, but you can scale up to 16 VMs per CMG.  

7. Click **Certificates** to add client trusted root certificates. Add up to two trusted root CAs, and four intermediate (subordinate) CAs.  

8. By default, the wizard enables the option to **Verify Client Certificate Revocation**. A certificate revocation list (CRL) must be publicly published for this verification to work. If you do not publish a CRL, deselect this option.  

9. Click **Next**.  

10. To monitor CMG traffic with a 14-day threshold, choose the check box to turn on the threshold alert. Then, specify the threshold, and the percentage at which to raise the different alert levels. Choose **Next** when you're done.  

11. Review the settings, and choose **Next**. Configuration Manager starts setting up the service. After you close the wizard, it will take between five to 15 minutes to provision the service completely in Azure. Check the **Status** column for the new CMG to determine when the service is ready.  

 > [!Note]  
 > To troubleshoot CMG deployments, use **CloudMgr.log** and **CMGSetup.log**. For more information, see [Log files](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files#cloud-management-gateway).



## Configure primary site for client certificate authentication

If you are using [client authentication certificates](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway#client-authentication-certificate) for clients to authenticate with the CMG, follow this procedure to configure each primary site.  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select **Sites**.  

2. Select the primary site to which your internet-based clients are assigned, and choose **Properties**.  

3. Switch to the **Client Computer Communications** tab of the primary site property sheet, check **Use PKI client certificate (client authentication) when available**.  

4. If you do not publish a CRL, deselect the option for **Clients check the certificate revocation list (CRL) for site systems**.  



## Add the CMG connection point

The CMG connection point is the site system role for communicating with the CMG. To add the CMG connection point, follow the general instructions to [install site system roles](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/install-site-system-roles). On the System Role Selection page of the Add Site System Role Wizard, select **Cloud management gateway connection point**. Then select the **Cloud management gateway name** to which this server connects. The wizard shows the region for the selected CMG. 

> [!Important]
> The CMG connection point must have a [client authentication certificate](/sccm/core/clients/manage/cmg/certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway#client-authentication-certificate) in some scenarios. 

 > [!Note]  
 > To troubleshoot CMG service health, use **CMGService.log** and **SMS_Cloud_ProxyConnector.log**. For more information, see [Log files](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files#cloud-management-gateway).



## Configure client-facing roles for CMG traffic

Configure the management point and software update point site systems to accept CMG traffic. Perform this procedure on the primary site, for all management points and software update points that service internet-based clients.  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, right-click **Servers and Site System Roles**, and select **Management point** from the list.  

2. Select the site system server you want to configure for CMG traffic. Select the **Management point** role in the details pane, and then click **Properties** in the ribbon.  

3. In the Management point properties sheet under Client Connections, check the box next to **Allow Configuration Manager cloud management gateway traffic**. Depending upon your CMG design, you may need to enable the **HTTPS** option. Click **OK**.   

Repeat these steps for additional management points as needed, and for any software update points. 



## Configure clients for CMG

Once the CMG and site system roles are running, clients get the location of the CMG service automatically on the next location request. Clients must be on the intranet to receive the location of the CMG service, unless you [install and assign Windows 10 clients using Azure AD for authentication](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-cmg-azure). The polling cycle for location requests is every 24 hours. If you don't want to wait for the normally scheduled location request, you can force the request by restarting the SMS Agent Host service (ccmexec.exe) on the computer.  

> [!Note]
> By default all clients receive CMG policy. Control this behavior with the client setting, [Enable clients to use a cloud management gateway](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings#enable-clients-to-use-a-cloud-management-gateway).

The Configuration Manager client automatically determines whether itâ€™s on the intranet or the internet. If the client can contact a domain controller or an on-premises management point, it sets its connection type to **Currently intranet**. Otherwise, it switches to **Currently Internet**, and uses the location of the CMG service to communicate with the site.

>[!NOTE]
> You can force the client to always use the CMG regardless of whether itâ€™s on the intranet or internet. This configuration is useful for testing purposes, or for clients at remote offices that you want to force to use the CMG. Set the following registry key on the client:
>
> `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CCM\Security, ClientAlwaysOnInternet = 1`
>
> You can also specify this setting during client installation using the [CCMALWAYSINF](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/about-client-installation-properties#ccmalwaysinf) property.

To verify that clients have the policy specifying the CMG, open a Windows PowerShell command prompt as an administrator on the client computer, and run the following command: 
`Get-WmiObject -Namespace Root\Ccm\LocationServices -Class SMS_ActiveMPCandidate | Where-Object {$_.Type -eq "Internet"}`

This command displays any internet-based management points the client knows about. While the CMG is not technically an internet-based management point, it appears as such to clients.

 > [!Note]  
 > To troubleshoot CMG client traffic, use **CMGHttpHandler.log**, **CMGService.log**, and **SMS_Cloud_ProxyConnector.log**. For more information, see [Log files](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files#cloud-management-gateway).



## Modify a CMG

After creating a CMG, you can modify some of its settings. Select the CMG in the Configuration Manager console and click **Properties**. The following settings are configurable:  

- **General**  

    - **Azure management certificate**: change the Azure management certificate for the CMG. This option is useful when updating the certificate before it expires.  

- **Settings**  

    - **Certificate file**: change the server authentication certificate for the CMG. This option is useful when updating the certificate before it expires.  

    - **VM Instance**: change the number of virtual machines that the service uses in Azure. This setting allows you to dynamically scale the service up or down based on utilization or cost considerations.  

    - **Certificates**: add or remove trusted root or intermediate CA certificates. This option is useful when adding new CAs, or retiring expired certificates.  

    - **Verify Client Certificate Revocation**: if you did not originally enable this setting when creating the CMG, you can enable it afterwards once you publish the CRL.  

- **Alerts**: you can reconfigure the alerts at anytime after you create the CMG. 

More significant changes, such as the following configurations, require redeploying the service:
- Classic deployment method to Azure Resource Manager
- Subscription
- Service name
- Private to public PKI
- Region

Always keep at least one active CMG for internet-based clients to receive updated policy. Internet-based clients can't communicate with a removed CMG. Clients don't know about a new one until they roam back to the intranet. When creating a second CMG instance in order to delete the first, also create another CMG connection point.

Clients refresh policy by default every 24 hours, so wait at least one day after creating a new CMG before you delete the old one. If clients are turned off or without an internet connection, you may need to wait longer. 

Starting in version 1802, if you have an existing CMG on the classic deployment method, you must deploy a new CMG to use the Azure Resource Manager deployment method.<!--509753--> There are two options:
- If you want to reuse the same service name:
    1. First delete the classic CMG, taking into account the guidance to always have at least one active CMG for internet-based clients.
    2. Create a new CMG using a Resource Manager deployment. Reuse the same server authentication certificate.
    3. Reconfigure the CMG connection point to use the new CMG instance.
- If you want to use a new service name:
    1. Create a new CMG using a Resource Manager deployment. Use a new server authentication certificate.
    2. Create a new CMG connection point and link with the new CMG.
    3. Wait at least one day for internet-based clients to receive policy about the new CMG.
    4. Delete the classic CMG.
